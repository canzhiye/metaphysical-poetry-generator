Oh my black soul! now art thou summoned By sickness, death's herald, and champion; Thou art like a pilgrim, which abroad hath done Treason, and durst not turn to whence he is fled; Or like a thief, which till death's doom be read, Wisheth himself delivered from prison, But damned and haled to execution, Wisheth that still he might be imprisoned. Yet grace, if thou repent, thou canst not lack; But who shall give thee that grace to begin? Oh make thy self with holy mourning black, And red with blushing, as thou art with sin; Or wash thee in Christ's blood, which hath this might That being red, it dyes red souls to white Take heed of loving me; At least remember I forbade it thee; Not that I shall repair my unthrifty waste Of breath and blood, upon thy sighs and tears, By being to thee then what to me thou wast; But so great joy our life at once outwears; Then, lest thy love by my death frustrate be, If thou love me, take heed of loving me.  Take heed of hating me, Or too much triumph in the victory; Not that I shall be mine own officer, And hate with hate again retaliate; But thou wilt lose the style of conqueror If I, thy conquest, perish by thy hate; Then, lest my being nothing lessen thee, If thou hate me, take heed of hating me.  Yet, love and hate me too; So, these extremes shall neither's office do; Love me, that I may die the gentler way; Hate me, because thy love is too great for me; Or let these two themselves, not me, decay; So shall I live thy stage, not triumph be; Lest thou thy love and hate and me undo, To let me live, O love and hate me too. Father, part of his double interest Unto thy kingdom, thy Son gives to me, His jointure in the knotty Trinity He keeps, and gives to me his death's conquest. This Lamb, whose death with life the world hath blest, Was from the world's beginning slain, and he Hath made two Wills which with the Legacy Of his and thy kingdom do thy Sons invest. Yet such are thy laws that men argue yet Whether a man those statutes can fulfil; None doth; but all-healing grace and spirit Revive again what law and letter kill. Thy law's abridgement, and thy last command Is all but love; Oh let this last Will stand! No spring nor summer Beauty hath such grace As I have seen in one autumnall face. Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape, This doth but counsel, yet you cannot 'scape. If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame, Affection here takes Reverence's name. Were her first years the Golden Age; that's true, But now she's gold oft tried, and ever new. That was her torrid and inflaming time, This is her tolerable Tropique clime. Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence, He in a fever wishes pestilence. Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were, They were Love's graves; for else he is no where. Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit Vowed to this trench, like an Anachorit.  And here, till hers, which must be his death, come, He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb. Here dwells he, though he sojourn ev'ry where, In progress, yet his standing house is here. Here, where still evening is; not noon, nor night; Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight In all her words, unto all hearers fit, You may at revels, you at counsel, sit. This is Love's timber, youth his under-wood; There he, as wine in June enrages blood, Which then comes seasonabliest, when our taste And appetite to other things is past. Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the Platane tree, Was loved for age, none being so large as she, Or else because, being young, nature did bless Her youth with age's glory, Barrenness. If we love things long sought, Age is a thing Which we are fifty years in compassing; If transitory things, which soon decay, Age must be loveliest at the latest day. But name not winter-faces, whose skin's slack; Lank, as an unthrift's purse; but a soul's sack; Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade; Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made; Whose every tooth to a several place is gone, To vex their souls at Resurrection; Name not these living deaths-heads unto me, For these, not ancient, but antique be. I hate extremes; yet I had rather stay With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day. Since such love's natural lation is, may still My love descend, and journey down the hill, Not panting after growing beauties so, I shall ebb out with them, who homeward go. Oh, to vex me, contraries meet in one: Inconstancy unnaturally hath begot A constant habit; that when I would not I change in vows, and in devotion. As humorous is my contrition As my profane love, and as soon forgot: As riddlingly distempered, cold and hot, As praying, as mute; as infinite, as none. I durst not view heaven yesterday; and today In prayers and flattering speeches I court God: Tomorrow I quake with true fear of his rod. So my devout fits come and go away Like a fantastic ague; save that here Those are my best days, when I shake with feare. Believe me, this was true last night, Tho' it is false to-day. -- A.M.F. Robinson.   A fair dream to my chamber flew: Such a crowd of folk that stirred, Jested, fluttered; only you, You alone of all that band, Calm and silent, spake no word. Only once you neared my place, And your hand one moment's space Sought the fingers of my hand; Your eyes flashed to mine; I knew All was well between us two.        On from dream to dream I past, But the first sweet vision cast Mystic radiance o'er the last.        When I woke the pale night lay Still, expectant of the day; All about the chamber hung Tender shade of twilight gloom; The fair dream hovered round me, clung To my thought like faint perfume:-- Like sweet odours, such as cling To the void flask, which erst encloses Attar of rose; or the pale string Of amber which has lain with roses. I have a friend who still believes in heaven. Not a stupid person, yet with all she knows, she literally talks to God. She thinks someone listens in heaven. On earth she's unusually competent. Brave too, able to face unpleasantness.  We found a caterpillar dying in the dirt, greedy ants crawling over it. I'm always moved by disaster, always eager to oppose vitality But timid also, quick to shut my eyes. Whereas my friend was able to watch, to let events play out According to nature.  For my sake she intervened Brushing a few ants off the torn thing, and set it down Across the road.  My friend says I shut my eyes to God, that nothing else explains My aversion to reality.  She says I'm like the child who Buries her head in the pillow So as not to see, the child who tells herself That light causes sadness- My friend is like the mother. Patient, urging me To wake up an adult like herself, a courageous person-  In my dreams, my friend reproaches me.  We're walking On the same road, except it's winter now; She's telling me that when you love the world you hear celestial music: Look up, she says. When I look up, nothing. Only clouds, snow, a white business in the trees Like brides leaping to a great height- Then I'm afraid for her; I see her Caught in a net deliberately cast over the earth-  In reality, we sit by the side of the road, watching the sun set; From time to time, the silence pierced by a birdcall. It's this moment we're trying to explain, the fact That we're at ease with death, with solitude. My friend draws a circle in the dirt; inside, the caterpillar doesn't move. She's always trying to make something whole, something beautiful, an image Capable of life apart from her. We're very quiet. It's peaceful sitting here, not speaking, The composition Fixed, the road turning suddenly dark, the air Going cool, here and there the rocks shining and glittering- It's this stillness we both love. The love of form is a love of endings. If faithful souls be alike glorified As angels, then my fathers soul doth see, And adds this even to full felicity, That valiantly I hells wide mouth o'erstride: But if our minds to these souls be descried By circumstances, and by signs that be Apparent in us, not immediately, How shall my mind's white truth by them be tried? They see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn, And vile blasphemous conjurers to call On Jesus name, and Pharisaical Dissemblers feigne devotion. Then turn, O pensive soul, to God, for he knows best Thy true grief, for he put it in my breast. Why are we by all creatures waited on? Why do the prodigal elements supply Life and food to me, being more pure than I, Simple, and further from corruption? Why brook'st thou, ignorant horse, subjection? Why dost thou, bull, and bore so seelily, Dissemble weakness, and by one man's stroke die, Whose whole kind you might swallow and feed upon? Weaker I am, woe is me, and worse than you, You have not sinned, nor need be timorous. But wonder at a greater wonder, for to us Created nature doth these things subdue, But their Creator, whom sin nor nature tied, For us, His creatures, and His foes, hath died. O might those sighs and tears return again Into my breast and eyes, which I have spent, That I might in this holy discontent Mourn with some fruit, as I have mourned in vain; In mine Idolatry what showers of rain Mine eyes did waste! what griefs my heart did rent! That sufferance was my sin; now I repent; 'Cause I did suffer I must suffer pain. Th' hydropic drunkard, and night-scouting thief, The itchy lecher, and self-tickling proud Have the remembrance of past joys for relief Of comming ills. To (poor) me is allowed No ease; for long, yet vehement grief hath been Th' effect and cause, the punishment and sin. As due by many titles I resign My self to Thee, O God; first I was made By Thee, and for Thee, and when I was decayed Thy blood bought that, the which before was Thine; I am Thy son, made with Thy Self to shine, Thy servant, whose pains Thou hast still repaid, Thy sheep, thine image, and, till I betrayed My self, a temple of Thy Spirit divine; Why doth the devil then usurp on me? Why doth he steal, nay ravish that's thy right? Except thou rise and for thine own work fight, Oh I shall soon despair, when I do see That thou lov'st mankind well, yet wilt not choose me, And Satan hates me, yet is loth to lose me. At the round earth's imagined corners blow Your trumpets, angels, and arise, arise From death, you numberless infinities Of souls, and to your scattered bodies go, All whom the flood did, and fire shall, overthrow, All whom war, dearth, age, agues, tyrannies, Despair, law, chance, hath slain, and you whose eyes Shall behold God, and never taste death's woe. But let them sleep, Lord, and me mourn a space, For, if above all these my sins abound, 'Tis late to ask abundance of Thy grace, When we are there. Here on this lowly ground Teach me how to repent; for that's as good As if Thou'dst sealed my pardon, with Thy blood. Upon this Primrose hill, Where, if Heav'n would distil A shower of rain, each several drop might go To his own primrose, and grow manna so; And where their form and their infinity Make a terrestrial Galaxy, As the small stars do in the sky: I walk to find a true Love; and I see That 'tis not a mere woman that is she, But must or more or less than woman be.  Yet know I not which flower I wish; a six, or four; For should my true-Love less than woman be She were scarce any thing; and then, should she Be more than woman she would get above All thought of sex, and think to move My heart to study her, and not to love; Both these were monsters; since there must reside Falsehood in woman, I could more abide She were by art than Nature falsified.  Live primrose then, and thrive With thy true number five; And woman, whom this flower doth represent, With this mysterious number be content; Ten is the farthest number; if half ten Belong unto each woman, then Each woman may take half us men; Or if this will not serve their turn, since all Numbers are odd or even, and they fall First into this, five, woman may take us all. Now thou hast loved me one whole day, Tomorrow when thou leav'st, what wilt thou say? Wilt thou then antedate some new made vow?       Or say that now We are not just those persons, which we were? Or, that oaths made in reverential fear Of Love, and his wrath, any may forswear? Or, as true deaths, true marriages untie, So lovers' contracts, images of those, Bind but till sleep, death's image, them unloose?       Or, your own end to justify, For having purposed change, and falsehood, you Can have no way but falsehood to be true? Vain lunatic, against these 'scapes I could       Dispute, and conquer, if I would,       Which I abstain to do, For by tomorrow, I may think so too. Wilt thou love God, as he thee? Then digest, My soul, this wholesome meditation, How God the Spirit, by angels waited on In heaven, doth make his Temple in thy breast. The Father having begot a Son most blest, And still begetting, (for he ne'er be gone) Hath deigned to choose thee by adoption, Co-heir t' his glory, and Sabbath' endless rest. And as a robbed man, which by search doth find His stol'n stuff sold, must lose or buy 't again: The Son of glory came down, and was slain, Us whom he'd made, and Satan stol'n, to unbind. 'Twas much that man was made like God before, But, that God should be made like man, much more. Wilt thou forgive that sin where I begun, Which is my sin, though it were done before? Wilt thou forgive that sin through which I run, And do run still, though still I do deplore? When thou hast done, thou hast not done, For I have more.  Wilt thou forgive that sin by which I have won Others to sin? and made my sin their door? Wilt thou forgive that sin which I did shun A year or two, but wallowed in a score? When thou hast done, thou hast not done, For I have more.  I have a sin of fear, that when I have spun My last thread, I shall perish on the shore; Swear by thyself, that at my death thy Son Shall shine as he shines now and heretofore; And, having done that, thou hast done, I fear no more. If poisonous minerals, and if that tree Whose fruit threw death on else immortal us, If lecherous goats, if serpents envious Cannot be damned, alas, why should I be? Why should intent or reason, born in me, Make sins, else equal, in me more heinous? And Mercy being easy, and glorious To God; in his stern wrath, why threatens he? But who am I, that dare dispute with thee O God? Oh! of thine only worthy blood, And my tears, make a heavenly Lethean flood, And drown in it my sin's black memory; That thou remember them, some claim as debt, I think it mercy, if thou wilt forget. Twice or thrice had I loved thee, Before I knew thy face or name, So in a voice, so in a shapeless flame, Angels affect us oft, and worship'd be; Still when, to where thou wert, I came, Some lovely glorious nothing I did see. But since my soul, whose child love is, Takes limbs of flesh, and else could nothing do, More subtile than the parent is, Love must not be, but take a body too, And therefore what thou wert, and who, I bid Love ask, and now That it assume thy body, I allow, And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow.  Whilst thus to ballast love, I thought, And so more steadily to have gone, With wares which would sink admiration, I saw, I had love's pinnace overfraught, Ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon Is much too much, some fitter must be sought; For, nor in nothing, nor in things Extreme, and scatt'ring bright, can love inhere; Then as an Angel, face, and wings Of air, not pure as it, yet pure doth wear, So thy love may be my loves sphere; Just such disparity As is twixt Air and Angels' purity, 'Twixt women's love, and men's will ever be. Since she whom I loved hath paid her last debt To Nature, and to hers, and my good is dead, And her soul early into heaven ravished, Wholly on heavenly things my mind is set. here the admiring her my mind did whet To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head; But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed, a holy thristy dropsy melts me yet. But why should I beg more love, whenas thou Dost woo my soul, for hers offering all thine: And dost not only fear lest I allow My love to saints and angels, things divine, but in they tender jealousy dost doubt lest the world, flesh, yea, devil put thee out. Spit in my face you Jews, and pierce my side, Buffet, and scoff, scourge, and crucify me, For I have sinned, and sinned, and only he Who could do no iniquity hath died: But by my death can not be satisfied My sins, which pass the Jews' impiety: They killed once an inglorious man, but I Crucify him daily, being now glorified. Oh let me, then, his strange love still admire: Kings pardon, but he bore our punishment. And Jacob came clothed in vile harsh attire But to supplant, and with gainful intent: God clothed himself in vile man's flesh, that so He might be weak enough to suffer woe. Show me, dear Christ, thy Spouse, so bright and clear. What! is it She, which on the other shore Goes richly painted? or which, robbed and tore, Laments and mourns in Germany and here? Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one year? Is she self-truth and errs? now new, now outwore? Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore On one, on seven, or on no hill appear? Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights First travail we to seek and then make love? Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our sights, And let mine amorous soul court thy mild dove, Who is most true and pleasing to thee then When she's embraced and open to most men. I am a little world made cunningly Of elements, and an angelic sprite; But black sin hath betrayed to endless night My worlds both parts, and (oh!) both parts must die. You which beyond that heaven which was most high Have found new spheres, and of new lands can write, Pour new seas in mine eyes, that so I might Drown my world with my weeping earnestly, Or wash it if it must be drowned no more: But oh it must be burnt! alas the fire Of lust and envy have burnt it heretofore, And made it fouler: Let their flames retire, And burn me, O Lord, with a fiery zeal Of Thee and Thy house, which doth in eating heal. This is my play's last scene, here heavens appoint My pilgrimage's last mile; and my race Idly, yet quickly run, hath this last pace, My span's last inch, my minute's latest point, And gluttonous death, will instantly unjoint My body and soul, and I shall sleep a space; But my ever-waking part shall see that face, Whose fear already shakes my every joint: Then, as my soul, t' heaven her first seat, takes flight, And earth-born body in the earth shall dwell, So fall my sins that all may have their right (To where they're bred, and would press me) to hell. Impute me righteous, thus purged of evil, For thus I leave the world, the flesh, the devil. Tho has made me, and shall thy work decay? Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste; I run to death, and death meets me as fast, And all my pleasures are like yesterday. I dare not move my dim eyes any way, Despair behind, and death before doth cast Such terror, and my feeble flesh doth waste By sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh. Only thou art above, and when towards thee By thy leave I can look, I rise again; But our old subtle foe so tempteth me That not one hour myself I can sustain. Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art, And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart. Whoever comes to shroud me, do not harm Nor question much That subtle wreath of hair which crowns my arm; The mystery, the sign, you must not touch, For 'tis my outward Soul, Viceroy to that which then to heaven being gone Will leave this to control And keep these limbs, her Provinces, from dissolution.  For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall Through every part Can tie those parts, and make me one of all, These hairs, which upward grew, and strength and art Have from a better brain, Can better do't; except she meant that I By this should know my pain, As prisoners then are manacled when they're condemned to die.  Whate'er she meant by 't, bury it with me, For since I am Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry If into others' hands these relics came; As 'twas humility To afford to it all that a Soul can do, So 'tis some bravery That since you would save none of me, I bury some of you. What if this present were the world's last night? Mark in my heart, O soul, where thou dost dwell, The picture of Christ crucified, and tell Whether that countenance can thee affright, Tears in his eyes quench the amazing light, Blood fills his frowns, which from his pierced head fell. And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell, Which prayed forgiveness for his foes' fierce spite? No, no; but as in my idolatry I said to all my profane mistresses, Beauty, of pity, foulness only is A sign of rigour: so I say to thee, To wicked spirits are horrid shapes assigned, This beauteous form assures a piteous mind. Death, be not proud, though some have callèd thee Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so; For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow Die not, poor death, nor yet canst thou kill me. From rest and sleep, which yet thy pictures be, Much pleasure, then from thee much more, must low And soonest our best men with thee do go, Rest of their bones and soul's delivery. Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings and desperate men And dost with poison, war and sickness dwell, And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then ? One short sleep past, we wake eternally, And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die. Lord, who createdst man in wealth and store,    Though foolishly he lost the same,       Decaying more and more,           Till he became             Most poor:             With thee           O let me rise         As larks, harmoniously,     And sing this day thy victories:   Then shall the fall further the flight in me.      My tender age in sorrow did begin:    And still with sicknesses and shame       Thou didst so punish sin,            That I became             Most thin.             With thee            Let me combine      And feel this day thy victory:      For, if I imp my wing on thine,    Affliction shall advance the flight in me. Sorry I am, my God, sorry I am, That my offences course it in a ring. My thoughts are working like a busy flame, Until their cockatrice they hatch and bring: And when they once have perfected their draughts, My words take fire from my inflamed thoughts.  My words take fire fro m my inflamed thoughts, Which spit it forth like the Sicilian hill. They vent their wares, and pass them with their faults, And by their breathing ventilate the ill. But words suffice not, where are lewd intentions: My hands do join to finish the inventions.  My hands do join to finish the inventions: And so my sins ascend three stories high, As Babel grew, before there were dissentions. Let ill deeds loiter not: for they supply New thoughts of sinning: wherefore, to my shame, Sorry I am, my God, sorry I am. Oh my black soul! now art thou summoned By sickness, death's herald, and champion; Thou art like a pilgrim, which abroad hath done Treason, and durst not turn to whence he is fled; Or like a thief, which till death's doom be read, Wisheth himself delivered from prison, But damned and haled to execution, Wisheth that still he might be imprisoned. Yet grace, if thou repent, thou canst not lack; But who shall give thee that grace to begin? Oh make thy self with holy mourning black, And red with blushing, as thou art with sin; Or wash thee in Christ's blood, which hath this might That being red, it dyes red souls to white I.  Time, thy name is sorrow, says the stricken Heart of life, laid waste with wasting flame Ere the change of things and thoughts requicken, Time, thy name.  Girt about with shadow, blind and lame, Ghosts of things that smite and thoughts that sicken Hunt and hound thee down to death and shame.  Eyes of hours whose paces halt or quicken Read in bloodred lines of loss and blame, Writ where cloud and darkness round it thicken, Time, thy name.  II.  Nay, but rest is born of me for healing, - So might haply time, with voice represt, Speak: is grief the last gift of my dealing? Nay, but rest.  All the world is wearied, east and west, Tired with toil to watch the slow sun wheeling, Twelve loud hours of life's laborious quest.  Eyes forspent with vigil, faint and reeling, Find at last my comfort, and are blest, Not with rapturous light of life's revealing - Nay, but rest. Since, Lord, to thee A narrow way and little gate Is all the passage, on my infancy Thou didst lay hold, and antedate My faith in me.  O let me still Write thee great God, and me a child: Let me be soft and supple to thy will, Small to my self, to others mild, Behither ill.  Although by stealth My flesh get on, yet let her sister My soul bid nothing, but preserve her wealth: The growth of flesh is but a blister; Childhood is health. The harbingers are come. See, see their mark; White is their colour, and behold my head. But must they have my brain? must they dispark Those sparkling notions, which therein were bred? Must dulnesse turn me to a clod? Yet have they left me, Thou art still my God.  Good men ye be, to leave me my best room, Ev'n all my heart, and what is lodged there: I passe not, I, what of the rest become, So Thou art still my God, be out of fear. He will be pleased with that dittie; And if I please him, I write fine and wittie.  Farewell sweet phrases, lovely metaphors. But will ye leave me thus? when ye before Of stews and brothels onely knew the doores, Then did I wash you with my tears, and more, Brought you to Church well drest and clad; My God must have my best, ev'n all I had.  Louely enchanting language, sugar-cane, Hony of roses, whither wilt thou flie? Hath some fond lover tic'd thee to thy bane? And wilt thou leave the Church, and love a stie? Fie, thou wilt soil thy broider'd coat, And hurt thy self, and him that sings the note.  Let foolish lovers, if they will love dung, With canvas, not with arras clothe their shame: Let follie speak in her own native tongue. True beautie dwells on high: ours is a flame But borrow'd thence to light us thither. Beautie and beauteous words should go together.  Yet if you go, I passe not; take your way: For, Thou art still my God, is all that ye Perhaps with more embellishment can say, Go birds of spring: let winter have his fee, Let a bleak palenesse chalk the doore, So all within be livelier then before. 'O DREARY life,' we cry, ' O dreary life ! ' And still the generations of the birds Sing through our sighing, and the flocks and herds Serenely live while we are keeping strife With Heaven's true purpose in us, as a knife Against which we may struggle ! Ocean girds Unslackened the dry land, savannah-swards Unweary sweep, hills watch unworn, and rife Meek leaves drop year]y from the forest-trees To show, above, the unwasted stars that pass In their old glory: O thou God of old, Grant me some smaller grace than comes to these !-- But so much patience as a blade of grass Grows by, contented through the heat and cold. I Got me flowers to straw Thy way, I got me boughs off many a tree; But Thou wast up by break of day, And brought’st Thy sweets along with Thee.  The sunne arising in the East, Though he give light, and th’ East perfume, If they should offer to contest With Thy arising, they presume.  Can there be any day but this, Though many sunnes to shine endeavour? We count three hundred, but we misse: There is but one, and that one ever. See the land, her Easter keeping, Rises as her Maker rose. Seeds, so long in darkness sleeping, Burst at last from winter snows. Earth with heaven above rejoices; Fields and gardens hail the spring; Shaughs and woodlands ring with voices, While the wild birds build and sing.  You, to whom your Maker granted Powers to those sweet birds unknown, Use the craft by God implanted; Use the reason not your own. Here, while heaven and earth rejoices, Each his Easter tribute bring- Work of fingers, chant of voices, Like the birds who build and sing. Why should such gloomy silence reign; And why is all the house so drear, When neither danger, sickness, pain, Nor death, nor want have entered here? We are as many as we were That other night, when all were gay, And full of hope, and free from care; Yet, is there something gone away.  The moon without as pure and calm Is shining as that night she shone; but now, to us she brings no balm, For something from our hearts is gone.  Something whose absence leaves a void, A cheerless want in every heart. Each feels the bliss of all destroyed And mourns the change - but each apart.  The fire is burning in the grate As redly as it used to burn, But still the hearth is desolate Till Mirth and Love with Peace return.  'Twas Peace that flowed from heart to heart With looks and smiles that spoke of Heaven, And gave us language to impart The blissful thoughts itself had given.  Sweet child of Heaven, and joy of earth! O, when will Man thy value learn? We rudely drove thee from our hearth, And vainly sigh for thy return. The Flower must not blame the Bee -- That seeketh his felicity Too often at her door --  But teach the Footman from Vevay -- Mistress is "not at home" -- to say -- To people -- any more! Since, Lord, to thee A narrow way and little gate Is all the passage, on my infancy Thou didst lay hold, and antedate My faith in me.  O let me still Write thee great God, and me a child: Let me be soft and supple to thy will, Small to my self, to others mild, Behither ill.  Although by stealth My flesh get on, yet let her sister My soul bid nothing, but preserve her wealth: The growth of flesh is but a blister; Childhood is health. Sweetest of sweets, I thank you: when displeasure Did through my body wound my mind, You took me thence, and in your house of pleasure A dainty lodging me assigned.  Now I in you without a body move, Rising and falling with your wings: We both together sweetly live and love, Yet say sometimes, "God help poor Kings".  Comfort, I'll die; for if you post from me Sure I shall do so, and much more: But if I travel in your company, You know the way to heaven's door. The winter wind is loud and wild, Come close to me, my darling child; Forsake thy books, and mateless play; And, while the night is gathering grey, We'll talk its pensive hours away;--  'Ierne, round our sheltered hall November's gusts unheeded call; Not one faint breath can enter here Enough to wave my daughter's hair, And I am glad to watch the blaze Glance from her eyes, with mimic rays; To feel her cheek so softly pressed, In happy quiet on my breast.  'But, yet, even this tranquillity Brings bitter, restless thoughts to me; And, in the red fire's cheerful glow, I think of deep glens, blocked with snow; I dream of moor, and misty hill, Where evening closes dark and chill; For, lone, among the mountains cold, Lie those that I have loved of old. And my heart aches, in hopeless pain Exhausted with repinings vain, That I shall greet them ne'er again!'  'Father, in early infancy, When you were far beyond the sea, Such thoughts were tyrants over me! I often sat, for hours together, Through the long nights of angry weather, Raised on my pillow, to descry The dim moon struggling in the sky;  Or, with strained ear, to catch the shock, Of rock with wave, and wave with rock; So would I fearful vigil keep, And, all for listening, never sleep. But this world's life has much to dread, Not so, my Father, with the dead.  'Oh! not for them, should we despair, The grave is drear, but they are not there; Their dust is mingled with the sod, Their happy souls are gone to God! You told me this, and yet you sigh, And murmur that your friends must die. Ah! my dear father, tell me why?  For, if your former words were true, How useless would such sorrow be; As wise, to mourn the seed which grew Unnoticed on its parent tree, Because it fell in fertile earth, And sprang up to a glorious birth-- Struck deep its root, and lifted high Its green boughs, in the breezy sky.  'But, I'll not fear, I will not weep For those whose bodies rest in sleep,-- I know there is a blessed shore, Opening its ports for me, and mine; And, gazing Time's wide waters o'er, I weary for that land divine, Where we were born, where you and I Shall meet our Dearest, when we die; From suffering and corruption free, Restored into the Deity.'  'Well hast thou spoken, sweet, trustful child! And wiser than thy sire; And worldly tempests, raging wild, Shall strengthen thy desire-- Thy fervent hope, through storm and foam, Through wind and ocean's roar, To reach, at last, the eternal home, The steadfast, changeless, shore!' Since that I may not have Love on this side the grave, Let me imagine Love. Since not mine is the bliss Of 'claspt hands and lips that kiss,' Let me in dreams it prove. What tho' as the years roll No soul shall melt to my soul, Let me conceive such thing; Tho' never shall entwine Loving arms around mine Let dreams caresses bring. To live--it is my doom-- Lonely as in a tomb, This cross on me was laid; My God, I know not why; Here in the dark I lie, Lonely, yet not afraid. It has seemed good to Thee Still to withhold the key Which opes the way to men; I am shut in alone, I make not any moan, Thy ways are past my ken. Yet grant me this, to find The sweetness in my mind Which I must still forego; Great God which art above, Grant me to image Love,-- The bliss without the woe. Oh King of grief! (a title strange, yet true, To thee of all kings only due) Oh King of wounds! how shall I grieve for thee, Who in all grief preventest me? Shall I weep blood? why thou has wept such store That all thy body was one door. Shall I be scourged, flouted, boxed, sold? 'Tis but to tell the tale is told. 'My God, my God, why dost thou part from me? ' Was such a grief as cannot be. Shall I then sing, skipping, thy doleful story, And side with thy triumphant glory? Shall thy strokes be my stroking? thorns, my flower? Thy rod, my posy? cross, my bower? But how then shall I imitate thee, and Copy thy fair, though bloody hand? Surely I will revenge me on thy love, And try who shall victorious prove. If thou dost give me wealth, I will restore All back unto thee by the poor. If thou dost give me honour, men shall see, The honour doth belong to thee. I will not marry; or, if she be mine, She and her children shall be thine. My bosom friend, if he blaspheme thy name, I will tear thence his love and fame. One half of me being gone, the rest I give Unto some Chapel, die or live. As for thy passion - But of that anon, When with the other I have done. For thy predestination I'll contrive, That three years hence, if I survive, I'll build a spittle, or mend common ways, But mend mine own without delays. Then I will use the works of thy creation, As if I us'd them but for fashion. The world and I will quarrel; and the year Shall not perceive, that I am here. My music shall find thee, and ev'ry string Shall have his attribute to sing; That all together may accord in thee, And prove one God, one harmony. If thou shalt give me wit, it shall appear; If thou hast giv'n it me, 'tis here. Nay, I will read thy book, and never move Till I have found therein thy love; Thy art of love, which I'll turn back on thee, O my dear Saviour, Victory! Then for thy passion - I will do for that - Alas, my God, I know not what. That Providence which had so long the care Of Cromwell's head, and numbred ev'ry hair, Now in its self (the Glass where all appears) Had seen the period of his golden Years: And thenceforth onely did attend to trace, What death might least so sair a Life deface. The People, which what most they fear esteem, Death when more horrid so more noble deem; And blame the last Act, like Spectators vain, Unless the Prince whom they applaud be slain. Nor Fate indeed can well refuse that right To those that liv'd in War, to dye in Fight. But long his Valour none had left that could Indanger him, or Clemency that would. And he whom Nature all for Peace had made, But angry Heaven unto War had sway'd, And so less useful where he most desir'd, For what he least affected was admir'd, Deserved yet an End whose ev'ry part Should speak the wondrous softness of his Heart. To Love and Grief the fatal Writ was sign'd; (Those nobler weaknesses of humane Mind, From which those Powers that issu'd the Decree, Although immortal, found they were not free.) That they, to whom his Breast still open lyes, In gentle Passions should his Death disguise: And leave succeeding Ages cause to mourn, As long as Grief shall weep, or Love shall burn. Streight does a slow and languishing Disease Eliza, Natures and his darling, seize. Her when an infant, taken with her Charms, He oft would flourish in his mighty Arms; And, lest their force the tender burthen wrong, Slacken the vigour of his Muscles strong; Then to the Mothers brest her softly move, Which while she drain'd of Milk she fill'd with Love: But as with riper Years her Virtue grew, And ev'ry minute adds a Lustre new; When with meridian height her Beauty shin'd, And thorough that sparkled her fairer Mind; When She with Smiles serene and Words discreet His hidden Soul at ev'ry turn could meet; Then might y' ha' daily his Affection spy'd, Doubling that knot which Destiny had ty'd: While they by sence, not knowing, comprehend How on each other both their Fates depend. With her each day the pleasing Hours he shares, And at her Aspect calms her growing Cares; Or with a Grandsire's joy her Children sees Hanging about her neck or at his knees. Hold fast dear Infants, hold them both or none; This will not stay when once the other's gone. A silent fire now wasts those Limbs of Wax, And him with his tortur'd Image racks. So the Flowr with'ring which the Garden crown'd, The sad Root pines in secret under ground. Each Groan he doubled and each Sigh he sigh'd, Repeated over to the restless Night. No trembling String compos'd to numbers new, Answers the touch in Notes more sad more true. She lest He grieve hides what She can her pains, And He to lessen hers his Sorrow feigns: Yet both perceiv'd, yet both conceal'd their Skills, And so diminishing increast their ills: That whether by each others grief they fell, Or on their own redoubled, none can tell. And now Eliza's purple Locks were shorn, Where she so long her Fathers fate had worn: And frequent lightning to her Soul that flyes, Devides the Air, and opens all the Skyes: And now his Life, suspended by her breath, Ran out impetuously to hasting Death. Like polish'd Mirrours, so his steely Brest Had ev'ry figure of her woes exprest; And with the damp of her last Gasps obscur'd, Had drawn such staines as were not to be cur'd. Fate could not either reach with single stroke, But the dear Image fled the Mirrour broke. Who now shall tell us more of mournful Swans, Of Halcyons kind, or bleeding Pelicans? No downy breast did ere so gently beat, Or fan with airy plumes so soft an heat. For he no duty by his height excus'd, Nor though a Prince to be a Man refus'd: But rather then in his Eliza's pain Not love, not grieve, would neither live nor reign. And in himself so oft immortal try'd, Yet in compassion of another dy'd. So have I seen a Vine, whose lasting Age Of many a Winter hath surviv'd the rage. Under whose shady tent Men ev'ry year At its rich bloods expence their Sorrows chear, If some dear branch where it extends its life Chance to be prun'd by an untimely knife, The Parent-Tree unto the Grief succeeds, And through the Wound its vital humour bleeds; Trickling in watry drops, whose flowing shape Weeps that it falls ere fix'd into a Grape. So the dry Stock, no more that spreading Vine, Frustrates the Autumn and the hopes of Wine. A secret Cause does sure those Signs ordain Fore boding Princes falls, and seldom vain. Whether some Kinder Pow'rs, that wish us well, What they above cannot prevent, foretell; Or the great World do by consent presage, As hollow Seas with future Tempests rage: Or rather Heav'n, which us so long fore sees, Their fun'rals celebrate while it decrees. But never yet was any humane Fate By nature solemniz'd with so much state. He unconcern'd the dreadful passage crost; But oh what pangs that Death did Nature cost! First the great Thunder was shot off, and sent The Signal from the starry Battlement. The Winds receive it, and its force out-do, As practising how they could thunder too: Out of the Binders Hand the Sheaves they tore, And thrash'd the Harvest in the airy floore; Or of huge Trees, whose growth with his did rise, The deep foundations open'd to the Skyes. Then heavy Showres the winged Tempests dead, And pour the Deluge ore the Chaos head. The Race of warlike Horses at his Tomb Offer themselves in many an Hecatomb; With pensive head towards the ground they fall, And helpless languish at the tainted Stall. Numbers of Men decrease with pains unknown, And hasten not to see his Death their own. Such Tortures all the Elements unfix'd, Troubled to part where so exactly mix'd. And as through Air his wasting Spirits flow'd, The Universe labour'd beneath their load. Nature it seem'd with him would Nature vye; He with Eliza, It with him would dye. He without noise still travell'd to his End, As silent Suns to meet the Night descend. The Stars that for him fought had only pow'r Left to determine now his fatal Hour, Which, since they might not hinder, yet they cast To chuse it worthy of his Glories past. No part of time but bore his mark away Of honour; all the Year was Cromwell's day But this, of all the most auspicious found, Twice had in open field him Victor crown'd When up the armed Mountains of Dunbar He march'd, and through deep Severn ending war. What day should him eternize but the same That had before immortaliz'd his Name? That so who ere would at his Death have joy'd, In their own Griefs might find themselves imploy'd; But those that sadly his departure griev'd, Yet joy'd remembring what he once atcheiv'd. And the last minute his victorious Ghost Gave chase to Ligny on the Belgick Coast. Here ended all his mortal toyles: He lay'd And slept in Peace under the Lawrel Shade. O Cromwell, Heavens Favourite! To none Have such high honours from above been shown: For whom the Elements we Mourners see, And Heav'n it self would the great Herald be; Which with more Care set forth his Obsequies Then those of Moses hid from humane Eyes; As jealous only here lest all be less, That we could to his Memory express. Then let us to our course of Mourning keep: Where Heaven leads, 'tis Piety to weep. Stand back ye Seas, and shrunk beneath the vail Of your Abysse, with cover'd Head bewail Your Monarch: We demand not your supplies To compass in our Isle; our Tears suffice; Since him away the dismal Tempest rent, Who once more joyn'd us to the Continent; Who planted England on the Flandrick shoar, And stretch'd our frontire to the Indian Ore; Whose greater Truths obscure the Fables old, Whether of British Saints or Worthy's told; And in a valour less'ning Arthur's deeds, For Holyness the Confessor exceeds. He first put Armes into Religions hand, And tim'rous Conscience unto Courage man'd: The Souldier taught that inward Mail to wear, And fearing God how they should nothing fear. Those Strokes he said will pierce through all below Where those that strike from Heaven fetch their Blow.  Note: The remainder is supplied from Ms Eng.poet.d. Astonish'd armyes did their flight prepare: And Cityes strong were stormed by his prayer. Of that for ever Prestons field shall tell The Story, and impregnable Clonmell. And where the sandy mountain Fenwick scald The Sea between yet henee his pray'r prevail'd. What man was ever so in Heav'n obey'd Since the commanded Sun ore Gibeon stayd. In all his warrs needs must he triumph, when He conquer'd God still ere he fought with men. Hence though in battle none so brave or fierce Yet him the adverse steel could never pierce: Pitty it seem'd to hurt him more that felt Each wound himself which he to others delt, Danger it self refusing to offend So loose an enemy so fast a freind. Friendship that sacred versue long das claime The first foundation of his house and name. But within one its narrow limitts fall His tendernesse extended unto all: And that deep soule through every chanell flows Where kindly nature loves it self to lose. More strong affections never reason serv'd Yet still affected most what best deservd. If he Eliza lov'd to that degree (Though who more worstly to be lov'd then she) If so indulgent to his own, how deare To him the children of the Highest were? For her he once did natures tribute pay: For these his life adventur'd every day. And it would be found could we his thoughts have Their griefs struck deepest if Eliza's last. What prudence more then humane did he need To keep so deare, so diff'ring mindes agreed? The worser sort as conscious of their ill, Lye weak and easy to the rulers will: But to the good (too many or too few). All law is uselesse all reward is due. Oh ill advis'd if not for love for shame. Spare yet your own if you neglect his fame. Least others dare to think your reale a maske And you to govern only Heavens taske. Valour, Religion, Friendship, Prudence dy'd At once with him and all that's good beside: And rue deaths refuse natures dreg's confin'd To loathsome life Alas are left behinde: Where we (so once we us'd) shall now no more To fetch day presse about his chamber door; From which he issu'd with that awfull state It seem'd Mars broke through Janus double gate: Yet alwayes temper'd with an Aire so mild No Aprill suns that ere so gently smil'd: No more shall heare that powerfull language charm. Whose force oft spar'd the labour of his arm: No more shall follow where he spent the dayes In warres in counsell, or in pray'r, and praise, Whose meanest acts he would himself advance As ungirt David to the Arks did dance. All All is gone of ours or his delight In horses fierce wild deer or armour bright. Francisca faire can nothing now but weep Nor with soft notes shall sing his cares asleep. I saw him dead, a leaden slumber lyes And mortall sleep over those wakefull eys: Those gentle Rayes under the lidds were fled Which through his lookes that piercing sweetnesse she That port which so Majestique was and strong, Loose and depriv'd of vigour stretch'd along: All wither'd, all discolour'd, pale and wan, How much another thing, no more thatman? Oh humane glory vaine, Oh death, Oh wings, Oh worthlesse worth. Oh transitory things. Yet dwelt that greatnesse in his shape decay'd That still though dead greater than death he lay'd. And in his alter'd face you something faigne That threatens death he yet will live againe. Not much unlike the saired Oake which shoots To heav'n its branches and through earth its roots: Whose spacious boughs are hung with Trophees row And honour'd wreaths have oft the Victour crown When angry Jove darts lightning through the Aire At mortalls sins, nor his own plant will spare (It groanes and bruses all below that stood So many yeares the shelter of the wood) The tree ere while foreshorten'd to our view When foln shews taller yet then as it grew. So shall his praise to after times increase When truth shall be allow'd and faction cease. And his own shadow with him fall. The Eye Detracts from objects then it selfe more high: But when death takes them from that envy'd seate Seing how little we confesse how greate. Thee many ages hence in martiall verse Shall th' English souldier ere he charge rehearse: Singing of thee influme themselves to fight And with the name of Cromwell armyes fright. As long as rivers to the seas shall runne. As long as Cynthia shall relieve the sunne, While staggs shall fly unto the forests thick, While sheep delight the grassy downs to pick, As long as future time succeeds the past, Always thy honour, praise and name shall last. Thou in a pitch how farre, beyond the sphere Of humane glory towr'st, and raigning there Despoyld of mortall robes, in seas of cliyse Plunging dost bathe, and tread the bright Abysse: There thy greate soule yet once a world das see Spacious enough and pure enough for thee. How soon thou Moses hast and Josua found And David for the Sword, and harpe renown'd? How streight canst to each happy Mansion goe? (Farr Better known above then here below) And in those joyes dost spend the endlesse day Which in expressing we our selves betray. For we since thou art gone with heavy doome Wander like ghosts about thy loved tombe: And lost in tears have neither sight nor minde To guide us upward through this Region blinde Since thou art gone who best that way could'st fearn Onely our sighs perhaps may thither reach. And Richard yet where his great Parent led Beats on the rugged track: He vertue dead Revives, and by his milder beams assures; And yet how much of them his griefe obscures? He as his rather long was kept from sight In private to be view'd by better light: But open'd once, what splendour dos he throw A Cromwell in an houre a Prince will grow. How he becomes that seat, how strongly streins How gently winds at once the ruling Reins? Heav'n to this choise prepar'd a Diadem Richer then any Eastern silk or gemme: A pearly rainbow; where the Sun inchas'd His brows like an Imperiall Jewell grac'd. We find already what those Omens mean. Earth nere more glad, nor Heaven more serene: Cease now our griefs, Calme peace succeeds a war Rainbows to storms, Richard to Oliver. Tempt not his clemency to try his pow'r He threats no Deluge, yet fore tells a showre. Like the vain Curlings of the Watry maze, Which in smooth streams a sinking Weight does raise; So Man, declining alwayes, disappears. In the Weak Circles of increasing Years; And his short Tumults of themselves Compose, While flowing Time above his Head does close. Cromwell alone with greater Vigour runs, (Sun-like) the Stages of succeeding Suns: And still the Day which he doth next restore, Is the just Wonder of the Day before. Cromwell alone doth with new Lustre spring, And shines the Jewel of the yearly Ring. 'Tis he the force of scatter'd Time contracts, And in one Year the Work of Ages acts: While heavy Monarchs make a wide Return, Longer, and more Malignant then Saturn: And though they all Platonique years should raign, In the same Posture would be found again. Their earthly Projects under ground they lay, More slow and brittle then the China clay: Well may they strive to leave them to their Son, For one Thing never was by one King don. Yet some more active for a Frontier Town Took in by Proxie, beggs a false Renown; Another triumphs at the publick Cost, And will have Wonn, if he no more have Lost; They fight by Others, but in Person wrong, And only are against their Subjects strong; Their other Wars seem but a feign'd contest, This Common Enemy is still opprest; If Conquerors, on them they turn their might; If Conquered, on them they wreak their Spight: They neither build the Temple in their dayes, Nor Matter for succeeding Founders raise; Nor Sacred Prophecies consult within, Much less themselves to perfect them begin, No other care they bear of things above, But with Astrologers divine, and Jove, To know how long their Planet yet Reprives From the deserved Fate their guilty lives: Thus (Image-like) and useless time they tell, And with vain Scepter strike the hourly Bell; Nor more contribute to the state of Things, Then wooden Heads unto the Viols strings, While indefatigable Cromwell hyes, And cuts his way still nearer to the Skyes, Learning a Musique in the Region clear, To tune this lower to that higher Sphere. So when Amphion did the Lute command, Which the God gave him, with his gentle hand, The rougher Stones, unto his Measures hew'd, Dans'd up in order from the Quarreys rude; This took a Lower, that an Higher place, As he the Treble alter'd, or the Base: No Note he struck, but a new Story lay'd, And the great Work ascended while he play'd. The listning Structures he with Wonder ey'd, And still new Stopps to various Time apply'd: Now through the Strings a Martial rage he throws, And joyng streight the Theban Tow'r arose; Then as he strokes them with a Touch more sweet, The flocking Marbles in a Palace meet; But, for he most the graver Notes did try, Therefore the Temples rear'd their Columns high: Thus, ere he ceas'd, his sacred Lute creates Th'harmonious City of the seven Gates. Such was that wondrous Order and Consent, When Cromwell tun'd the ruling Instrument; While tedious Statesmen many years did hack, Framing a Liberty that still went back; Whose num'rous Gorge could swallow in an hour That Island, which the Sea cannot devour: Then our Amphion issues out and sings, And once he struck, and twice, the pow'rful Strings. The Commonwealth then first together came, And each one enter'd in the willing Frame; All other Matter yields, and may be rul'd; But who the Minds of stubborn Men can build? No Quarry bears a Stone so hardly wrought, Nor with such labour from its Center brought; None to be sunk in the Foundation bends, Each in the House the highest Place contends, And each the Hand that lays him will direct, And some fall back upon the Architect; Yet all compos'd by his attractive Song, Into the Animated City throng. The Common-wealth does through their Centers all Draw the Circumf'rence of the publique Wall; The crossest Spirits here do take their part, Fast'ning the Contignation which they thwart; And they, whose Nature leads them to divide, Uphold, this one, and that the other Side; But the most Equal still sustein the Height, And they as Pillars keep the Work upright; While the resistance of opposed Minds, The Fabrick as with Arches stronger binds, Which on the Basis of a Senate free, Knit by the Roofs Protecting weight agree. When for his foot he thus a place had found, He hurles e'r since the World about him round, And in his sev'ral Aspects, like a Star, Here shines in Peace, and thither shoots a War. While by his Beams observing Princes steer, And wisely court the Influence they fear, O would they rather by his Pattern won. Kiss the approaching, nor yet angry Son; And in their numbred Footsteps humbly tread The path where holy Oracles do lead; How might they under such a Captain raise The great Designs kept for the latter Dayes! But mad with reason, so miscall'd, of State They know them not, and what they know not, hate Hence still they sing Hosanna to the Whore, And her whom they should Massacre adore: But Indians whom they should convert, subdue; Nor teach, but traffique with, or burn the Jew. Unhappy Princes, ignorantly bred, By Malice some, by Errour more misled; If gracious Heaven to my Life give length, Leisure to Times, and to my Weakness Strength, Then shall I once with graver Accents shake Your Regal sloth, and your long Slumbers wake: Like the shrill Huntsman that prevents the East, Winding his Horn to Kings that chase the Beast. Till then my Muse shall hollow far behind Angelique Cromwell who outwings the wind; And in dark Nights, and in cold Dayes alone Pursues the Monster thorough every Throne: Which shrinking to her Roman Den impure, Gnashes her Goary teeth; nor there secure. Hence oft I think, if in some happy Hour High Grace should meet in one with highest Pow'r, And then a seasonable People still Should bend to his, as he to Heavens will, What we might hope, what wonderful Effect From such a wish'd Conjuncture might reflect. Sure, the mysterious Work, where none withstand, Would forthwith finish under such a Hand: Fore-shortned Time its useless Course would stay, And soon precipitate the latest Day. But a thick Cloud about that Morning lyes, And intercepts the Beams of Mortal eyes, That 'tis the most which we deteremine can, If these the Times, then this must be the Man. And well he therefore does, and well has guest, Who in his Age has always forward prest: And knowing not where Heavens choice may light, Girds yet his Sword, and ready stands to fight; But Men alas, as if they nothing car'd, Look on, all unconcern'd, or unprepar'd; And Stars still fall, and still the Dragons Tail Swinges the Volumes of its horrid Flail. For the great Justice that did first suspend The World by Sin, does by the same extend. Hence that blest Day still counterpoysed wastes, The ill delaying, what th'Elected hastes; Hence landing Nature to new Seas it tost, And good Designes still with their Authors lost. And thou, great Cromwell, for whose happy birth A Mold was chosen out of better Earth; Whose Saint-like Mother we did lately see Live out an Age, long as a Pedigree; That she might seem, could we the Fall dispute, T'have smelt the Blossome, and not eat the Fruit; Though none does of more lasting Parents grow, But never any did them Honor so; Though thou thine Heart from Evil still unstain'd, And always hast thy Tongue from fraud refrain'd, Thou, who so oft through Storms of thundring Lead Hast born securely thine undaunted Head, Thy Brest through ponyarding Conspiracies, Drawn from the Sheath of lying Prophecies; Thee proof beyond all other Force or Skill, Our Sins endanger, and shall one day kill. How near they fail'd, and in thy sudden Fall At once assay'd to overturn us all. Our brutish fury strugling to be Free, Hurry'd thy Horses while they hurry'd thee. When thou hadst almost quit thy Mortal cares, And soyl'd in Dust thy Crown of silver Hairs. Let this one Sorrow interweave among The other Glories of our yearly Song. Like skilful Looms which through the costly threed Of purling Ore, a shining wave do shed: So shall the Tears we on past Grief employ, Still as they trickle, glitter in our Joy. So with more Modesty we may be True, And speak as of the Dead the Praises due: While impious Men deceiv'd with pleasure short, On their own Hopes shall find the Fall retort. But the poor Beasts wanting their noble Guide, What could they move? shrunk guiltily aside. First winged Fear transports them far away, And leaden Sorrow then their flight did stay. See how they each his towring Crest abate, And the green Grass, and their known Mangers hate, Nor through wide Nostrils snuffe the wanton air, Nor their round Hoofs, or curled Mane'scompare; With wandring Eyes, and restless Ears theystood, And with shrill Neighings ask'd him of the Wood. Thou Cromwell falling, not a stupid Tree, Or Rock so savage, but it mourn'd for thee: And all about was heard a Panique groan, As if that Natures self were overthrown. It seem'd the Earth did from the Center tear; It seem'd the Sun was faln out of the Sphere: Justice obstructed lay, and Reason fool'd; Courage disheartned, and Religion cool'd. A dismal Silence through the Palace went, And then loud Shreeks the vaulted Marbles rent. Such as the dying Chorus sings by turns, And to deaf Seas, and ruthless Tempests mourns, When now they sink, and now the plundring Streams Break up each Deck, and rip the Oaken seams. But thee triumphant hence the firy Carr, And firy Steeds had born out of the Warr, From the low World, and thankless Men above, Unto the Kingdom blest of Peace and Love: We only mourn'd our selves, in thine Ascent, Whom thou hadst lest beneath with Mantle rent. For all delight of Life thou then didst lose, When to Command, thou didst thy self Depose; Resigning up thy Privacy so dear, To turn the headstrong Peoples Charioteer; For to be Cromwell was a greater thing, Then ought below, or yet above a King: Therefore thou rather didst thy Self depress, Yielding to Rule, because it made thee Less. For, neither didst thou from the first apply Thy sober Spirit unto things too High, But in thine own Fields exercisedst long, An Healthful Mind within a Body strong; Till at the Seventh time thou in the Skyes, As a small Cloud, like a Mans hand didst rise; Then did thick Mists and Winds the air deform, And down at last thou pow'rdst the fertile Storm; Which to the thirsty Land did plenty bring, But though forewarn'd, o'r-took and wet the King. What since he did, an higher Force him push'd Still from behind, and it before him rush'd, Though undiscern'd among the tumult blind, Who think those high Decrees by Man design'd. 'Twas Heav'n would not that his Pow'r should cease, But walk still middle betwixt War and Peace; Choosing each Stone, and poysing every weight, Trying the Measures of the Bredth and Height; Here pulling down, and there erecting New, Founding a firm State by Proportions true. When Gideon so did from the War retreat, Yet by Conquest of two Kings grown great, He on the Peace extends a Warlike power, And Is'rel silent saw him rase the Tow'r; And how he Succoths Elders durst suppress, With Thorns and Briars of the Wilderness. No King might ever such a Force have done; Yet would not he be Lord, nor yet his Son. Thou with the same strength, and an Heart as plain, Didst (like thine Olive) still refuse to Reign; Though why should others all thy Labor spoil, And Brambles be anointed with thine Oyl, Whose climbing Flame, without a timely stop, Had quickly Levell'd every Cedar's top. Therefore first growing to thy self a Law, Th'ambitious Shrubs thou in just time didst aw. So have I seen at Sea, when whirling Winds, Hurry the Bark, but more the Seamens minds, Who with mistaken Course salute the Sand, And threat'ning Rocks misapprehend for Land; While baleful Tritons to the shipwrack guide. And Corposants along the Tacklings slide. The Passengers all wearyed out before, Giddy, and wishing for the fatal Shore; Some lusty Mate, who with more careful Eye Counted the Hours, and ev'ry Star did spy, The Helm does from the artless Steersman strain, And doubles back unto the safer Main. What though a while they grumble discontent, Saving himself he does their loss prevent. 'Tis not a Freedome, that where All command; Nor Tyranny, where One does them withstand: But who of both the Bounders knows to lay Him as their Father must the State obey. Thou, and thine House, like Noah's Eight did rest, Left by the Wars Flood on the Mountains crest: And the large Vale lay subject to thy Will, Which thou but as an Husbandman would Till: And only didst for others plant the Vine Of Liberty, not drunken with its Wine. That sober Liberty which men may have, That they enjoy, but more they vainly crave: And such as to their Parents Tents do press, May shew their own, not see his Nakedness. Yet such a Chammish issue still does rage, The Shame and Plague both of the Land and Age, Who watch'd thy halting, and thy Fall deride, Rejoycing when thy Foot had slipt aside; that their new King might the fifth Scepter shake, And make the World, by his Example, Quake: Whose frantique Army should they want for Men Might muster Heresies, so one were ten. What thy Misfortune, they the Spirit call, And their Religion only is to Fall. Oh Mahomet! now couldst thou rise again, Thy Falling-sickness should have made thee Reign, While Feake and Simpson would in many a Tome, Have writ the Comments of thy sacred Foame: For soon thou mightst have past among their Rant Wer't but for thine unmoved Tulipant; As thou must needs have own'd them of thy band For prophecies fit to be Alcorand. Accursed Locusts, whom your King does spit Out of the Center of th'unbottom'd Pit; Wand'rers, Adult'rers, Lyers, Munser's rest, Sorcerers, Atheists, Jesuites, Possest; You who the Scriptures and the Laws deface With the same liberty as Points and Lace; Oh Race most hypocritically strict! Bent to reduce us to the ancient Pict; Well may you act the Adam and the Eve; Ay, and the Serpent too that did deceive. But the great Captain, now the danger's ore, Makes you for his sake Tremble one fit more; And, to your spight, returning yet alive Does with himself all that is good revive. So when first Man did through the Morning new See the bright Sun his shining Race pursue, All day he follow'd with unwearied sight, Pleas'd with that other World of moving Light; But thought him when he miss'd his setting beams, Sunk in the Hills, or plung'd below the Streams. While dismal blacks hung round the Universe, And Stars (like Tapers) burn'd upon his Herse: And Owls and Ravens with their screeching noyse Did make the Fun'rals sadder by their Joyes. His weeping Eyes the doleful Vigils keep, Not knowing yet the Night was made for sleep: Still to the West, where he him lost, he turn'd, And with such accents, as Despairing, mourn'd: Why did mine Eyes once see so bright a Ray; Or why Day last no longer than a Day? When streight the Sun behind him he descry'd, Smiling serenely from the further side. So while our Star that gives us Light and Heat, Seem'd now a long and gloomy Night to threat, Up from the other World his Flame he darts, And Princes shining through their windows starts; Who their suspected Counsellors refuse, And credulous Ambassadors accuse. "Is this, saith one, the Nation that we read "Spent with both Wars, under a Captain dead? "Yet rig a Navy while we dress us late; "And ere we Dine, rase and rebuild our State. "What Oaken Forrests, and what golden Mines! "What Mints of Men, what Union of Designes! "Unless their Ships, do, as their Fowle proceed "Of shedding Leaves, that with their Ocean breed. "Theirs are not Ships, but rather Arks of War, "And beaked Promontories sail'd from far; "Of floting Islands a new Hatched Nest; "A Fleet of Worlds, of other Worlds in quest; "An hideous shole of wood Leviathans, "Arm'd with three Tire of brazen Hurricans; "That through the Center shoot their thundring side "And sink the Earth that does at Anchor ride. 'What refuge to escape them can be found, "Whose watry Leaguers all the world surround? "Needs must we all their Tributaries be, "Whose Navies hold the Sluces of the Sea. "The Ocean is the Fountain of Command, "But that once took, we Captives are on Land: "And those that have the Waters for their share, "Can quickly leave us neither Earth nor Air. "Yet if through these our Fears could find a pass; "Through double Oak, & lin'd with treble Brass; "That one Man still, although but nam'd, alarms "More then all Men, all Navies, and all Arms. "Him, all the Day, Him, in late Nights I dread, "And still his Sword seems hanging o're my head. "The Nation had been ours, but his one Soul "Moves the great Bulk, and animates the whole. "He Secrecy with Number hath inchas'd, "Courage with Age, Maturity with Hast: "The Valiants Terror, Riddle of the Wise; "And still his Fauchion all our Knots unties. "Where did he learn those Arts that cost us dear? "Where below Earth, or where above the Sphere? "He seems a King by long Succession born, "And yet the same to be a King does scorn. "Abroad a King he seems, and something more, "At Home a Subject on the equal Floor. "O could I once him with our Title see, "So should I hope yet he might Dye as wee. "But let them write his Praise that love him best, "It grieves me sore to have thus much confest. "Pardon, great Prince, if thus their Fear or Spight "More then our Love and Duty do thee Right. "I yield, nor further will the Prize contend; "So that we both alike may miss our End: "While thou thy venerable Head dost raise "As far above their Malice as my Praise. "And as the Angel of our Commonweal, "Troubling the Waters, yearly mak'st them Heal. Holland, that scarce deserves the name of Land, As but th'Off-scouring of the Brittish Sand; And so much Earth as was contributed By English Pilots when they heav'd the Lead; Or what by th' Oceans slow alluvion fell, Of shipwrackt Cockle and the Muscle-shell; This indigested vomit of the Sea Fell to the Dutch by just Propriety. Glad then, as Miners that have found the Oar, They with mad labour fish'd the Land to Shoar; And div'd as desperately for each piece Of Earth, as if't had been of Ambergreece; Collecting anxiously small Loads of Clay, Less then what building Swallows bear away; Transfursing into them their Dunghil Soul. How did they rivet, with Gigantick Piles, Thorough the Center their new-catched Miles; And to the stake a strugling Country bound, Where barking Waves still bait the forced Ground; Building their watry Babel far more high To reach the Sea, then those to scale the Sky. Yet still his claim the Injur'd Ocean laid, And oft at Leap-frog ore their Steeples plaid: As if on purpose it on Land had come To shew them what's their Mare Liberum. A daily deluge over them does boyl; The Earth and Water play at Level-coyl; The Fish oft-times the Burger dispossest, And sat not as a Meat but as a Guest; And oft the Tritons and the Sea-Nymphs saw Whole sholes of Dutch serv'd up for Cabillan; Or as they over the new Level rang'd For pickled Herring, pickled Heeren chang'd. Nature, it seem'd, asham'd of her mistake, Would throw their land away at Duck and Drake. Therefore Necessity, that first made Kings, Something like Government among them brings. For as with Pygmees who best kills the Crane, Among the hungry he that treasures Grain, Among the blind the one-ey'd blinkard reigns, So rules among the drowned he that draines. Not who first see the rising Sun commands, But who could first discern the rising Lands. Who best could know to pump an Earth so leak Him they their Lord and Country's Father speak. To make a Bank was a great Plot of State; Invent a Shov'l and be a Magistrate. Hence some small Dyke-grave unperceiv'd invades The Pow'r, and grows as 'twere a King of Spades. But for less envy some Joynt States endures, Who look like a Commission of the Sewers. For these Half-anders, half wet, and half dry, Nor bear strict service, nor pure Liberty. 'Tis probable Religion after this Came next in order; which they could not miss. How could the Dutch but be converted, when Th' Apostles were so many Fishermen? Besides the Waters of themselves did rise, And, as their Land, so them did re-baptise. Though Herring for their God few voices mist, And Poor-John to have been th' Evangelist. Faith, that could never Twins conceive before, Never so fertile, spawn'd upon this shore: More pregnant then their Marg'ret, that laid down For Hans-in-Kelder of a whole Hans-Town. Sure when Religion did it self imbark, And from the east would Westward steer its Ark, It struck, and splitting on this unknown ground, Each one thence pillag'd the first piece he found: Hence Amsterdam, Turk-Christian-Pagan-Jew, Staple of Sects and Mint of Schisme grew; That Bank of Conscience, where not one so strange Opinion but finds Credit, and Exchange. In vain for Catholicks our selves we bear; The Universal Church is onely there. Nor can Civility there want for Tillage, Where wisely for their Court they chose a Village. How fit a Title clothes their Governours, Themselves the Hogs as all their Subjects Bores Let it suffice to give their Country Fame That it had one Civilis call'd by Name, Some Fifteen hundred and more years ago, But surely never any that was so. See but their Mairmaids with their Tails of Fish, Reeking at Church over the Chafing-Dish. A vestal Turf enshrin'd in Earthen Ware Fumes through the loop-holes of wooden Square. Each to the Temple with these Altars tend, But still does place it at her Western End: While the fat steam of Female Sacrifice Fills the Priests Nostrils and puts out his Eyes. Or what a Spectacle the Skipper gross, A Water-Hercules Butter-Coloss, Tunn'd up with all their sev'ral Towns of Beer; When Stagg'ring upon some Land, Snick and Sneer, They try, like Statuaries, if they can, Cut out each others Athos to a Man: And carve in their large Bodies, where they please, The Armes of the United Provinces. But when such Amity at home is show'd; What then are their confederacies abroad? Let this one court'sie witness all the rest; When their hole Navy they together prest, Not Christian Captives to redeem from Bands: Or intercept the Western golden Sands: No, but all ancient Rights and Leagues must vail, Rather then to the English strike their sail; to whom their weather-beaten Province ows It self, when as some greater Vessal tows A Cock-boat tost with the same wind and fate; We buoy'd so often up their Sinking State. Was this Jus Belli & Pacis; could this be Cause why their Burgomaster of the Sea Ram'd with Gun-powder, flaming with Brand wine, Should raging hold his Linstock to the Mine? While, with feign'd Treaties, they invade by stealth Our sore new circumcised Common wealth. Yet of his vain Attempt no more he sees Then of Case-Butter shot and Bullet-Cheese. And the torn Navy stagger'd with him home, While the Sea laught it self into a foam, 'Tis true since that (as fortune kindly sports,) A wholesome Danger drove us to our ports. While half their banish'd keels the Tempest tost, Half bound at home in Prison to the frost: That ours mean time at leisure might careen, In a calm Winter, under Skies Serene. As the obsequious Air and waters rest, Till the dear Halcyon hatch out all its nest. The Common wealth doth by its losses grow; And, like its own Seas, only Ebbs to flow. Besides that very Agitation laves, And purges out the corruptible waves. And now again our armed Bucentore Doth yearly their Sea-Nuptials restore. And how the Hydra of seaven Provinces Is strangled by our Infant Hercules. Their Tortoise wants its vainly stretched neck; Their Navy all our Conquest or our Wreck: Or, what is left, their Carthage overcome Would render fain unto our better Rome. Unless our Senate, lest their Youth disuse, The War, (but who would) Peace if begg'd refuse. For now of nothing may our State despair, Darling of Heaven, and of Men the Care; Provided that they be what they have been, Watchful abroad, and honest still within. For while our Neptune doth a Trident shake, Blake, Steel'd with those piercing Heads, Dean, Monck and And while Jove governs in the highest Sphere, Vainly in Hell let Pluto domineer. To the Lord Fairfax.  See how the arched Earth does here Rise in a perfect Hemisphere! The stiffest Compass could not strike A line more circular and like; Nor softest Pensel draw a Brow. So equal as this Hill does bow. It seems as for a Model laid, And that the World by it was made.  Here learn ye Mountains more unjust, Which to abrupter greatness thrust, That do with your hook-shoulder'd height The Earth deform and Heaven frght. For whose excrescence ill design'd, Nature must a new Center find, Learn here those humble steps to tread, Which to securer Glory lead.  See what a soft access and wide Lyes open to its grassy side; Nor with the rugged path deterrs The feet of breathless Travellers. See then how courteous it ascends, And all the way ir rises bends; Nor for it self the height does gain, But only strives to raise the Plain.  Yet thus it all the field commands, And in unenvy'd Greatness stands, Discerning furthe then the Cliff Of Heaven-daring Teneriff. How glad the weary Seamen hast When they salute it from the Mast! By Night the Northern Star their way Directs, and this no less by Day.  Upon its crest this Mountain grave A Plum of aged Trees does wave. No hostile hand durst ere invade With impious Steel the sacred Shade. For something alwaies did appear Of the Great Masters terrour there: And Men could hear his Armour still Ratling through all the Grove and Hill.  Fear of the Master, and respect Of the great Nymph did it protect; Vera the Nymph that him inspir'd, To whom he often here retir'd, And on these Okes ingrav'd her Name; Such Wounds alone these Woods became: But ere he well the Barks could part 'Twas writ already in their Heart.  For they ('tis credible) have sense, As we, of Love and Reverence, And underneath the Courser Rind The Genius of the house do bind. Hence they successes seem to know, And in their Lord's advancement grow; But in no Memory were seen As under this so streight and green.  Yet now no further strive to shoot, Contented if they fix their Root. Nor to the winds uncertain gust, Their prudent Heads too far intrust. Onely sometimes a flutt'ring Breez Discourses with the breathing Trees; Which in their modest Whispers name Those Acts that swell'd the Cheek of Fame.  Much other Groves, say they, then these And other Hills him once did please. Through Groves of Pikes he thunder'd then, And Mountains rais'd of dying Men. For all the Civick Garlands due To him our Branches are but few. Nor are our Trunks enow to bear The Trophees of one fertile Year.  'Tis true, the Trees nor ever spoke More certain Oracles in Oak. But Peace (if you his favour prize) That Courage its own Praises flies. Therefore to your obscurer Seats From his own Brightness he retreats: Nor he the Hills without the Groves, Nor Height but with Retirement loves. First was the world as one great cymbal made, Where jarring winds to infant Nature played. All music was a solitary sound, To hollow rocks and murm'ring fountains bound.  Jubal first made the wilder notes agree; And Jubal tuned music's Jubilee; He call'd the echoes from their sullen cell, And built the organ's city where they dwell.  Each sought a consort in that lovely place, And virgin trebles wed the manly bass. From whence the progeny of numbers new Into harmonious colonies withdrew.  Some to the lute, some to the viol went, And others chose the cornet eloquent, These practicing the wind, and those the wire, To sing men's triumphs, or in Heaven's choir.  Then music, the mosaic of the air, Did of all these a solemn noise prepare; With which she gain'd the empire of the ear, Including all between the earth and sphere.  Victorious sounds! yet here your homage do Unto a gentler conqueror than you; Who though he flies the music of his praise, Would with you Heaven's Hallelujahs raise. At the time when the stars are grey, And the gold of the molten moon Fades, and the twilight is thinned, And the sun leaps up, and the wind, A light rose, not of the day, A stronger light than of noon.  As the light of a face much loved Was the face of the light that clomb; As a mother's whitened with woes Her adorable head that arose; As the sound of a God that is moved, Her voice went forth upon Rome.  At her lips it fluttered and failed Twice, and sobbed into song, And sank as a flame sinks under; Then spake, and the speech was thunder, And the cheek as he heard it paled Of the wrongdoer grown grey with the wrong.  "Is it time, is it time appointed, Angel of time, is it near? For the spent night aches into day When the kings shall slay not or pray, And the high-priest, accursed and anointed, Sickens to deathward with fear.  "For the bones of my slain are stirred, And the seed of my earth in her womb Moves as the heart of a bud Beating with odorous blood To the tune of the loud first bird Burns and yearns into bloom.  "I lay my hand on her bosom, My hand on the heart of my earth, And I feel as with shiver and sob The triumphant heart in her throb, The dead petals dilate into blossom, The divine blood beat into birth.  "O my earth, are the springs in thee dry? O sweet, is thy body a tomb? Nay, springs out of springs derive, And summers from summers alive, And the living from them that die; No tomb is here, but a womb.  "O manifold womb and divine, Give me fruit of my children, give! I have given thee my dew for thy root, Give thou me for my mouth of thy fruit; Thine are the dead that are mine, And mine are thy sons that live.  "O goodly children, O strong Italian spirits, that wear My glories as garments about you, Could time or the world misdoubt you, Behold, in disproof of the wrong, The field of the grave-pits there.  "And ye that fell upon sleep, We have you too with us yet. Fairer than life or than youth Is this, to die for the truth: No death can sink you so deep As their graves whom their brethren forget.  "Were not your pains as my pains? As my name are your names not divine? Was not the light in your eyes Mine, the light of my skies, And the sweet shed blood of your veins, O my beautiful martyrs, mine?  "Of mine earth were your dear limbs made, Of mine air was your sweet life's breath; At the breasts of my love ye were fed, O my children, my chosen, my dead, At my breasts where again ye are laid, At the old mother's bosom, in death.  "But ye that live, O their brothers, Be ye to me as they were; Give me, my children that live, What these dead grudged not to give, Who alive were sons of your mother's, Whose lips drew breath of your air.  "Till darkness by dawn be cloven, Let youth's self mourn and abstain; And love's self find not an hour, And spring's self wear not a flower, And Lycoris, with hair unenwoven, Hail back to the banquet in vain.  "So sooner and surer the glory That is not with us shall be, And stronger the hands that smite The heads of the sons of night, And the sound throughout earth of our story Give all men heart to be free." Within this sober Frame expect Work of no Forrain Architect; That unto Caves the Quarries drew, And Forrests did to Pastures hew; Who of his great Design in pain Did for a Model vault his Brain, Whose Columnes should so high be rais'd To arch the Brows that on them gaz'd.  Why should of all things Man unrul'd Such unproportion'd dwellings build? The Beasts are by their Denns exprest: And Birds contrive an equal Nest; The low roof'd Tortoises do dwell In cases fit of Tortoise-shell: No Creature loves an empty space; Their Bodies measure out their Place.  But He, superfluously spread, Demands more room alive then dead. And in his hollow Palace goes Where Winds as he themselves may lose. What need of all this Marble Crust T'impark the wanton Mose of Dust, That thinks by Breadth the World t'unite Though the first Builders fail'd in Height?  But all things are composed here Like Nature, orderly and near: In which we the Dimensions find Of that more sober Age and Mind, When larger sized Men did stoop To enter at a narrow loop; As practising, in doors so strait, To strain themselves through Heavens Gate.  And surely when the after Age Shall hither come in Pilgrimage, These sacred Places to adore, By Vere and Fairfax trod before, Men will dispute how their Extent Within such dwarfish Confines went: And some will smile at this, as well As Romulus his Bee-like Cell.  Humility alone designs Those short but admirable Lines, By which, ungirt and unconstrain'd, Things greater are in less contain'd. Let others vainly strive t'immure The Circle in the Quadrature! These holy Mathematics can In ev'ry Figure equal Man.  Yet thus the laden House does sweat, And scarce indures the Master great: But where he comes the swelling Hall Stirs, and the Square grows Spherical; More by his Magnitude distrest, Then he is by its straitness prest: And too officiously it slights That in it self which him delights.  So Honour better Lowness bears, Then That unwonted Greatness wears Height with a certain Grace does bend, But low Things clownishly ascend. And yet what needs there here Excuse, Where ev'ry Thing does answer Use? Where neatness nothing can condemn, Nor Pride invent what to contemn?  A Stately Frontispice Of Poor Adorns without the open Door: Nor less the Rooms within commends Daily new Furniture Of Friends. The House was built upon the Place Only as for a Mark Of Grace; And for an Inn to entertain Its Lord a while, but not remain.  Him Bishops-Hill, or Denton may, Or Bilbrough, better hold then they: But Nature here hath been so free As if she said leave this to me. Art would more neatly have defac'd What she had laid so sweetly wast; In fragrant Gardens, shaddy Woods, Deep Meadows, and transparent Floods.  While with slow Eyes we these survey, And on each pleasant footstep stay, We opportunly may relate The progress of this Houses Fate. A Nunnery first gave it birth. For Virgin Buildings oft brought forth. And all that Neighbour-Ruine shows The Quarries whence this dwelling rose.  Near to this gloomy Cloysters Gates There dwelt the blooming Virgin Thwates, Fair beyond Measure, and an Heir Which might Deformity make fair. And oft She spent the Summer Suns Discoursing with the Suttle Nuns. Whence in these Words one to her weav'd, (As 'twere by Chance) Thoughts long conceiv'd.  "Within this holy leisure we "Live innocently as you see. "these Walls restrain the World without, "But hedge our Liberty about. "These Bars inclose the wider Den "Of those wild Creatures, called Men. "The Cloyster outward shuts its Gates, "And, from us, locks on them the Grates.  "Here we, in shining Armour white, "Like Virgin Amazons do fight. "And our chast Lamps we hourly trim, "Lest the great Bridegroom find them dim. "Our Orient Breaths perfumed are "With insense of incessant Pray'r. "And Holy-water of our Tears "Most strangly our complexion clears.  "Not Tears of Grief; but such as those "With which calm Pleasure overflows; "Or Pity, when we look on you "That live without this happy Vow. "How should we grieve that must be seen "Each one a Spouse, and each a Queen; "And can in Heaven hence behold "Our brighter Robes and Crowns of Gold?  "When we have prayed all our Beads, "Some One the holy Legend reads; "While all the rest with Needles paint "The Face and Graces of the Saint. "But what the Linnen can't receive "They in their Lives do interweave "This work the Saints best represents; "That serves for Altar's Ornaments.  "But much it to our work would add "If here your hand, your Face we had: "By it we would our Lady touch; "Yet thus She you resembles much. "Some of your Features, as we sow'd, "Through ev'ry Shrine should be bestow'd. "And in one Beauty we would take "Enough a thousand Saints to make.  "And (for I dare not quench the Fire "That me does for your good inspire) "'Twere Sacriledge a Mant t'admit "To holy things, for Heaven fit. "I see the Angels in a Crown "On you the Lillies show'ring down: "And round about you Glory breaks, "That something more then humane speaks.  "All Beauty, when at such a height, "Is so already consecrate. "Fairfax I know; and long ere this "Have mark'd the Youth, and what he is. "But can he such a Rival seem "For whom you Heav'n should disesteem? "Ah, no! and 'twould more Honour prove "He your Devoto were, then Love.  Here live beloved, and obey'd: Each one your Sister, each your Maid. "And, if our Rule seem strictly pend, "The Rule it self to you shall bend. "Our Abbess too, now far in Age, "Doth your succession near presage. "How soft the yoke on us would lye, "Might such fair Hands as yours it tye!  "Your voice, the sweetest of the Quire, "Shall draw Heav'n nearer, raise us higher. "And your Example, if our Head, "Will soon us to perfection lead. "Those Virtues to us all so dear, "Will straight grow Sanctity when here: "And that, once sprung, increase so fast "Till Miracles it work at last.  "Nor is our Order yet so nice, "Delight to banish as a Vice. "Here Pleasure Piety doth meet; "One perfecting the other Sweet. "So through the mortal fruit we boyl "The Sugars uncorrupting Oyl: "And that which perisht while we pull, "Is thus preserved clear and full.  "For such indeed are all our Arts; "Still handling Natures finest Parts. "Flow'rs dress the Altars; for the Clothes, "The Sea-born Amber we compose; "Balms for the griv'd we draw; and pasts "We mold, as Baits for curious tasts. "What need is here of Man? unless "These as sweet Sins we should confess.  "Each Night among us to your side "Appoint a fresh and Virgin Bride; "Whom if Our Lord at midnight find, "Yet Neither should be left behind. "Where you may lye as chast in Bed, "As Pearls together billeted. "All Night embracing Arm in Arm, "Like Chrystal pure with Cotton warm.  "But what is this to all the store "Of Joys you see, and may make more! "Try but a while, if you be wise: "The Tryal neither Costs, nor Tyes. Now Fairfax seek her promis'd faith: Religion that dispensed hath; Which She hence forward does begin; The Nuns smooth Tongue has suckt her in.  Oft, though he knew it was in vain, Yet would he valiantly complain. "Is this that Sanctity so great, "An Art by which you finly'r cheat "Hypocrite Witches, hence Avant, "Who though in prison yet inchant! "Death only can such Theeves make fast, "As rob though in the Dungeon cast.  "Were there but, when this House was made, "One Stone that a just Hand had laid, "It must have fall'n upon her Head "Who first Thee from thy Faith misled. "And yet, how well soever ment, "With them 'twould soon grow fraudulent "For like themselves they alter all, "And vice infects the very Wall.  "But sure those Buildings last not long, "Founded by Folly, kept by Wrong. "I know what Fruit their Gardens yield, "When they it think by Night conceal'd. "Fly from their Vices. 'Tis thy state, "Not Thee, that they would consecrate. "Fly from their Ruine. How I fear "Though guiltless lest thou perish there.  What should he do? He would respect Religion, but not Right neglect: For first Religion taught him Right, And dazled not but clear'd his sight. Sometimes resolv'd his Sword he draws, But reverenceth then the Laws: "For Justice still that Courage led; First from a Judge, then Souldier bred.  Small Honour would be in the Storm. The Court him grants the lawful Form; Which licens'd either Peace or Force, To hinder the unjust Divorce. Yet still the Nuns his Right debar'd, Standing upon their holy Guard. Ill-counsell'd Women, do you know Whom you resist, or what you do?  Is not this he whose Offspring fierce Shall fight through all the Universe; And with successive Valour try France, Poland, either Germany; Till one, as long since prophecy'd, His Horse through conquer'd Britain ride? Yet, against Fate, his Spouse they kept; And the great Race would intercept.  Some to the Breach against their Foes Their Wooden Saints in vain oppose Another bolder stands at push With their old Holy-Water Brush. While the disjointed Abbess threads The gingling Chain-shot of her Beads. But their lowd'st Cannon were their Lungs; And sharpest Weapons were their Tongues.  But, waving these aside like Flyes, Young Fairfax through the Wall does rise. Then th' unfrequented Vault appear'd, And superstitions vainly fear'd. The Relicks False were set to view; Only the Jewels there were true. But truly bright and holy Thwaites That weeping at the Altar waites.  But the glad Youth away her bears, And to the Nuns bequeaths her Tears: Who guiltily their Prize bemoan, Like Gipsies that a Child hath stoln. Thenceforth (as when th' Inchantment ends The Castle vanishes or rends) The wasting Cloister with the rest Was in one instant dispossest.  At the demolishing, this Seat To Fairfax fell as by Escheat. And what both Nuns and Founders will'd 'Tis likely better thus fulfill'd, For if the Virgin prov'd not theirs, The Cloyster yet remained hers. Though many a Nun there made her vow, 'Twas no Religious-House till now.  From that blest Bed the Heroe came, Whom France and Poland yet does fame: Who, when retired here to Peace, His warlike Studies could not cease; But laid these Gardens out in sport In the just Figure of a Fort; And with five Bastions it did fence, As aiming one for ev'ry Sense.  When in the East the Morning Ray Hangs out the Colours of the Day, The Bee through these known Allies hums, Beating the Dian with its Drumms. Then Flow'rs their drowsie Eylids raise, Their Silken Ensigns each displayes, And dries its Pan yet dank with Dew, And fills its Flask with Odours new.  These, as their Governour goes by, In fragrant Vollyes they let fly; And to salute their Governess Again as great a charge they press: None for the Virgin Nymph; for She Seems with the Flow'rs a Flow'r to be. And think so still! though not compare With Breath so sweet, or Cheek so faire.  Well shot ye Fireman! Oh how sweet, And round your equal Fires do meet; Whose shrill report no Ear can tell, But Ecchoes to the Eye and smell. See how the Flow'rs, as at Parade, Under their Colours stand displaid: Each Regiment in order grows, That of the Tulip Pinke and Rose.  But when the vigilant Patroul Of Stars walks round about the Pole, Their Leaves, that to the stalks are curl'd, Seem to their Staves the Ensigns furl'd. Then in some Flow'rs beloved Hut Each Bee as Sentinel is shut; And sleeps so too: but, if once stir'd, She runs you through, or askes The Word.  Oh Thou, that dear and happy Isle The Garden of the World ere while, Thou Paradise of four Seas, Which Heaven planted us to please, But, to exclude the World, did guard With watry if not flaming Sword; What luckless Apple did we tast, To make us Mortal, and The Wast.  Unhappy! shall we never more That sweet Milltia restore, When Gardens only had their Towrs, And all the Garrisons were Flow'rs, When Roses only Arms might bear, And Men did rosie Garlands wear? Tulips, in several Colours barr'd, Were then the Switzers of our Guard.  The Gardiner had the Souldiers place, And his more gentle Forts did trace. The Nursery of all things green Was then the only Magazeen. The Winter Quarters were the Stoves, Where he the tender Plants removes. But War all this doth overgrow: We Ord'nance Plant and Powder sow.  And yet their walks one on the Sod Who, had it pleased him and God, Might once have made our Gardens spring Fresh as his own and flourishing. But he preferr'd to the Cinque Ports These five imaginary Forts: And, in those half-dry Trenches, spann'd Pow'r which the Ocean might command.  For he did, with his utmost Skill, Ambition weed, but Conscience till. Conscience, that Heaven-nursed Plant, Which most our Earthly Gardens want. A prickling leaf it bears, and such As that which shrinks at ev'ry touch; But Flow'rs eternal, and divine, That in the Crowns of Saints do shine.  The sight does from these Bastions ply, Th' invisible Artilery; And at proud Cawood Castle seems To point the Battery of its Beams. As if it quarrell'd in the Seat Th' Ambition of its Prelate great. But ore the Meads below it plays, Or innocently seems to gaze.  And now to the Abbyss I pass Of that unfathomable Grass, Where Men like Grashoppers appear, But Grashoppers are Gyants there: They, in there squeking Laugh, contemn Us as we walk more low then them: And, from the Precipices tall Of the green spir's, to us do call.  To see Men through this Meadow Dive, We wonder how they rise alive. As, under Water, none does know Whether he fall through it or go. But, as the Marriners that sound, And show upon their Lead the Ground, They bring up Flow'rs so to be seen, And prove they've at the Bottom been.  No Scene that turns with Engines strange Does oftner then these Meadows change, For when the Sun the Grass hath vext, The tawny Mowers enter next; Who seem like Israaliies to be, Walking on foot through a green Sea. To them the Grassy Deeps divide, And crowd a Lane to either Side.  With whistling Sithe, and Elbow strong, These Massacre the Grass along: While one, unknowing, carves the Rail, Whose yet unfeather'd Quils her fail. The Edge all bloody from its Breast He draws, and does his stroke detest; Fearing the Flesh untimely mow'd To him a Fate as black forebode.  But bloody Thestylis, that waites To bring the mowing Camp their Cates, Greedy as Kites has trust it up, And forthwith means on it to sup: When on another quick She lights, And cryes, he call'd us Israelites; But now, to make his saying true, Rails rain for Quails, for Manna Dew.  Unhappy Birds! what does it boot To build below the Grasses Root; When Lowness is unsafe as Hight, And Chance o'retakes what scapeth spight? And now your Orphan Parents Call Sounds your untimely Funeral. Death-Trumpets creak in such a Note, And 'tis the Sourdine in their Throat.  Or sooner hatch or higher build: The Mower now commands the Field; In whose new Traverse seemeth wrought A Camp of Battail newly fought: Where, as the Meads with Hay, the Plain Lyes quilted ore with Bodies slain: The Women that with forks it filing, Do represent the Pillaging.  And now the careless Victors play, Dancing the Triumphs of the Hay; Where every Mowers wholesome Heat Smells like an Alexanders Sweat. Their Females fragrant as the Mead Which they in Fairy Circles tread: When at their Dances End they kiss, Their new-made Hay not sweeter is.  When after this 'tis pil'd in Cocks, Like a calm Sea it shews the Rocks: We wondring in the River near How Boats among them safely steer. Or, like the Desert Memphis Sand, Short Pyramids of Hay do stand. And such the Roman Camps do rise In Hills for Soldiers Obsequies.  This Scene again withdrawing brings A new and empty Face of things; A levell'd space, as smooth and plain, As Clothes for Lilly strecht to stain. The World when first created sure Was such a Table rase and pure. Or rather such is the Toril Ere the Bulls enter at Madril.  For to this naked equal Flat, Which Levellers take Pattern at, The Villagers in common chase Their Cattle, which it closer rase; And what below the Sith increast Is pincht yet nearer by the Breast. Such, in the painted World, appear'd Davenant with th'Universal Heard.  They seem within the polisht Grass A landskip drawen in Looking-Glass. And shrunk in the huge Pasture show As spots, so shap'd, on Faces do. Such Fleas, ere they approach the Eye, In Multiplyiug Glasses lye. They feed so wide, so slowly move, As Constellatious do above.  Then, to conclude these pleasant Acts, Denton sets ope its Cataracts; And makes the Meadow truly be (What it but seem'd before) a Sea. For, jealous of its Lords long stay, It try's t'invite him thus away. The River in it self is drown'd, And Isl's th' astonish Cattle round.  Let others tell the Paradox, How Eels now bellow in the Ox; How Horses at their Tails do kick, Turn'd as they hang to Leeches quick; How Boats can over Bridges sail; And Fishes do the Stables scale. How Salmons trespassing are found; And Pikes are taken in the Pound.  But I, retiring from the Flood, Take Sanctuary in the Wood; And, while it lasts, my self imbark In this yet green, yet growing Ark; Where the first Carpenter might best Fit Timber for his Keel have Prest. And where all Creatures might have shares, Although in Armies, not in Paires.  The double Wood of ancient Stocks Link'd in so thick, an Union locks, It like two Pedigrees appears, On one hand Fairfax, th' other Veres: Of whom though many fell in War, Yet more to Heaven shooting are: And, as they Natures Cradle deckt, Will in green Age her Hearse expect.  When first the Eye this Forrest sees It seems indeed as Wood not Trees: As if their Neighbourhood so old To one great Trunk them all did mold. There the huge Bulk takes place, as ment To thrust up a Fifth Element; And stretches still so closely wedg'd As if the Night within were hedg'd.  Dark all without it knits; within It opens passable and thin; And in as loose an order grows, As the Corinthean Porticoes. The Arching Boughs unite between The Columnes of the Temple green; And underneath the winged Quires Echo about their tuned Fires.  The Nightingale does here make choice To sing the Tryals of her Voice. Low Shrubs she sits in, and adorns With Musick high the squatted Thorns. But highest Oakes stoop down to hear, And listning Elders prick the Ear. The Thorn, lest it should hurt her, draws Within the Skin its shrunken claws.  But I have for my Musick found A Sadder, yet more pleasing Sound: The Stock-doves whose fair necks are grac'd With Nuptial Rings their Ensigns chast; Yet always, for some Cause unknown, Sad pair unto the Elms they moan. O why should such a Couple mourn, That in so equal Flames do burn!  Then as I carless on the Bed Of gelid Straw-berryes do tread, And through the Hazles thick espy The hatching Thrastles shining Eye, The Heron from the Ashes top, The eldest of its young lets drop, As if it Stork-like did pretend That Tribute to its Lord to send.  But most the Hewel's wonders are, Who here has the Holt-felsters care. He walks still upright from the Root, Meas'ring the Timber with his Foot; And all the way, to keep it clean, Doth from the Bark the Wood-moths glean. He, with his Beak, examines well Which fit to stand and which to fell.  The good he numbers up, and hacks; As if he mark'd them with the Ax. But where he, tinkling with his Beak, Does find the hollow Oak to speak, That for his building he designs, And through the tainted Side he mines. Who could have thought the tallest Oak Should fall by such a feeble Strok'!  Nor would it, had the Tree not fed A Traitor-worm, within it bred. (As first our Flesh corrupt within Tempts impotent and bashful Sin. And yet that Worm triumphs not long, But serves to feed the Hewels young. While the Oake seems to fall content, Viewing the Treason's Punishment.  Thus I, easie Philosopher, Among the Birds and Trees confer: And little now to make me, wants Or of the Fowles, or of the Plants. Give me but Wings as they, and I Streight floting on the Air shall fly: Or turn me but, and you shall see I was but an inverted Tree.  Already I begin to call In their most-learned Original: And where I Language want,my Signs The Bird upon the Bough divines; And more attentive there doth sit Then if She were with Lime-twigs knit. No Leaf does tremble in the Wind Which I returning cannot find.  Out of these scatter'd Sibyls Leaves Strange Prophecies my Phancy weaves: And in one History consumes, Like Mexique Paintings, all the Plumes. What Rome, Greece, Palestine, ere said I in this light Mosaick read. Thrice happy he who, not mistook, Hath read in Natures mystick Book.  And see how Chance's better Wit Could with a Mask my studies hit! The Oak-Leaves me embroyder all, Between which Caterpillars crawl: And Ivy, with familiar trails, Me licks, and clasps, and curles, and hales. Under this antick Cope I move Like some great Prelate of the Grove,  Then, languishing with ease, I toss On Pallets swoln of Velvet Moss; While the Wind, cooling through the Boughs, Flatters with Air my panting Brows. Thanks for my Rest ye Mossy Banks, And unto you cool Zephyr's Thanks, Who, as my Hair, my Thoughts too shed, And winnow from the Chaff my Head.  How safe, methinks, and strong, behind These Trees have I incamp'd my Mind; Where Beauty, aiming at the Heart, Bends in some Tree its useless Dart; And where the World no certain Shot Can make, or me it toucheth not. But I on it securely play, And gaul its Horsemen all the Day.  Bind me ye Woodbines in your 'twines, Curle me about ye gadding Vines, And Oh so close your Circles lace, That I may never leave this Place: But, lest your Fetters prove too weak, Ere I your Silken Bondage break, Do you, O Brambles, chain me too, And courteous Briars nail me though.  Here in the Morning tye my Chain, Where the two Woods have made a Lane; While, like a Guard on either side, The Trees before their Lord divide; This, like a long and equal Thread, Betwixt two Labyrinths does lead. But, where the Floods did lately drown, There at the Ev'ning stake me down.  For now the Waves are fal'n and dry'd, And now the Meadows fresher dy'd; Whose Grass, with moister colour dasht, Seems as green Silks but newly washt. No Serpent new nor Crocodile Remains behind our little Nile; Unless it self you will mistake, Among these Meads the only Snake.  See in what wanton harmless folds It ev'ry where the Meadow holds; And its yet muddy back doth lick, Till as a Chrystal Mirrour slick; Where all things gaze themselves, and doubt If they be in it or without. And for his shade which therein shines, Narcissus like, the Sun too pines.  Oh what a Pleasure 'tis to hedge My Temples here with heavy sedge; Abandoning my lazy Side, Stretcht as a Bank unto the Tide; Or to suspend my sliding Foot On the Osiers undermined Root, And in its Branches tough to hang, While at my Lines the Fishes twang!  But now away my Hooks, my Quills, And Angles, idle Utensils. The Young Maria walks to night: Hide trifling Youth thy Pleasures slight. 'Twere shame that such judicious Eyes Should with such Toyes a Man surprize; She that already is the Law Of all her Sex, her Ages Aw.  See how loose Nature, in respect To her, it self doth recollect; And every thing so whisht and fine, Starts forth with to its Bonne Mine. The Sun himself, of Her aware, Seems to descend with greater Care, And lest She see him go to Bed, In blushing Clouds conceales his Head.  So when the Shadows laid asleep From underneath these Banks do creep, And on the River as it flows With Eben Shuts begin to close; The modest Halcyon comes in sight, Flying betwixt the Day and Night; And such an horror calm and dumb, Admiring Nature does benum.  The viscous Air, wheres'ere She fly, Follows and sucks her Azure dy; The gellying Stream compacts below, If it might fix her shadow so; The Stupid Fishes hang, as plain As Flies in Chrystal overt'ane, And Men the silent Scene assist, Charm'd with the saphir-winged Mist.  Maria such, and so doth hush The World, and through the Ev'ning rush. No new-born Comet such a Train Draws through the Skie, nor Star new-slain. For streight those giddy Rockets fail, Which from the putrid Earth exhale, But by her Flames, in Heaven try'd, Nature is wholly Vitrifi'd.  'Tis She that to these Gardens gave That wondrous Beauty which they have; She streightness on the Woods bestows; To Her the Meadow sweetness owes; Nothing could make the River be So Chrystal-pure but only She; She yet more Pure, Sweet, Streight, and Fair, Then Gardens, Woods, Meads, Rivers are.  Therefore what first She on them spent, They gratefully again present. The Meadow Carpets where to tread; The Garden Flow'rs to Crown Her Head; And for a Glass the limpid Brook, Where She may all her Beautyes look; But, since She would not have them seen, The Wood about her draws a Skreen.  For She, to higher Beauties rais'd, Disdains to be for lesser prais'd. She counts her Beauty to converse In all the Languages as hers; Not yet in those her self imployes But for the Wisdome, not the Noyse; Nor yet that Wisdome would affect, But as 'tis Heavens Dialect.  Blest Nymph! that couldst so soon prevent Those Trains by Youth against thee meant; Tears (watry Shot that pierce the Mind;) And Sighs (Loves Cannon charg'd with Wind;) True Praise (That breaks through all defence;) And feign'd complying Innocence; But knowing where this Ambush lay, She scap'd the safe, but roughest Way.  This 'tis to have been from the first In a Domestick Heaven nurst, Under the Discipline severe Of Fairfax, and the starry Vere; Where not one object can come nigh But pure, and spotless as the Eye; And Goodness doth it self intail On Females, if there want a Male.  Go now fond Sex that on your Face Do all your useless Study place, Nor once at Vice your Brows dare knit Lest the smooth Forehead wrinkled sit Yet your own Face shall at you grin, Thorough the Black-bag of your Skin; When knowledge only could have fill'd And Virtue all those Furows till'd.  Hence She with Graces more divine Supplies beyond her Sex the Line; And, like a sprig of Misleto, On the Fairfacian Oak does grow; Whence, for some universal good, The Priest shall cut the sacred Bud; While her glad Parents most rejoice, And make their Destiny their Choice.  Mean time ye Fields, Springs, Bushes, Flow'rs, Where yet She leads her studious Hours, (Till Fate her worthily translates, And find a Fairfax for our Thwaites) Employ the means you have by Her, And in your kind your selves preferr; That, as all Virgins She preceds, So you all Woods, Streams, Gardens, Meads.  For you Thessalian Tempe's Seat Shall now be scorn'd as obsolete; Aranjeuz, as less, disdain'd; The Bel-Retiro as constrain'd; But name not the Idalian Grove, For 'twas the Seat of wanton Love; Much less the Dead's Elysian Fields, Yet nor to them your Beauty yields.  'Tis not, what once it was, the World; But a rude heap together hurl'd; All negligently overthrown, Gulfes, Deserts, Precipices, Stone. Your lesser World contains the same. But in more decent Order tame; You Heaven's Center, Nature's Lap. And Paradice's only Map.  But now the Salmon-Fishers moist Their Leathern Boats begin to hoist; And, like Antipodes in Shoes, Have shod their Heads in their Canoos. How Tortoise like, but not so slow, These rational Amphibii go? Let's in: for the dark Hemisphere Does now like one of them appear. As one put drunk into the Packet-boat, Tom May was hurry'd hence and did not know't. But was amaz'd on the Elysian side, And with an Eye uncertain, gazing wide, Could not determine in what place he was, For whence in Stevens ally Trees or Grass. Nor where the Popes head, nor the Mitre lay, Signs by which still he found and lost his way. At last while doubtfully he all compares, He saw near hand, as he imagin'd Ares. Such did he seem for corpulence and port, But 'twas a man much of another sort; 'Twas Ben that in the dusky Laurel shade Amongst the Chorus of old Poets laid, Sounding of ancient Heroes, such as were The Subjects Safety, and the Rebel's Fear. But how a double headed Vulture Eats, Brutus and Cassius the Peoples cheats. But seeing May he varied streight his song, Gently to signifie that he was wrong. Cups more then civil of Emilthian wine, I sing (said he) and the Pharsalian Sign, Where the Historian of the Common-wealth In his own Bowels sheath'd the conquering health. By this May to himself and them was come, He found he was tranflated, and by whom. Yet then with foot as stumbling as his tongue Prest for his place among the Learned throng. But Ben, who knew not neither foe nor friend, Sworn Enemy to all that do pretend, Rose more then ever he was seen severe, Shook his gray locks, and his own Bayes did tear At this intrusion. Then with Laurel wand, The awful Sign of his supream command. At whose dread Whisk Virgil himself does quake, And Horace patiently its stroke does take, As he crowds in he whipt him ore the pate Like Pembroke at the Masque, and then did rate. Far from these blessed shades tread back agen Most servil' wit, and Mercenary Pen. Polydore, Lucan, Allan, Vandale, Goth, Malignant Poet and Historian both. Go seek the novice Statesmen, and obtrude On them some Romane cast similitude, Tell them of Liberty, the Stories fine, Until you all grow Consuls in your wine. Or thou Dictator of the glass bestow On him the Cato, this the Cicero. Transferring old Rome hither in your talk, As Bethlem's House did to Loretto walk. Foul Architect that hadst not Eye to see How ill the measures of these States agree. And who by Romes example England lay, Those but to Lucan do continue May. But the nor Ignorance nor seeming good Misled, but malice fixt and understood. Because some one than thee more worthy weares The sacred Laurel, hence are all these teares? Must therefore all the World be set on flame, Because a Gazet writer mist his aim? And for a Tankard-bearing Muse must we As for the Basket Guelphs and Gibellines be? When the Sword glitters ore the Judges head, And fear has Coward Churchmen silenced, Then is the Poets time, 'tis then he drawes, And single fights forsaken Vertues cause. He, when the wheel of Empire, whirleth back, And though the World disjointed Axel crack, Sings still of ancient Rights and better Times, Seeks wretched good, arraigns successful Crimes. But thou base man first prostituted hast Our spotless knowledge and the studies chast. Apostatizing from our Arts and us, To turn the Chronicler to Spartacus. Yet wast thou taken hence with equal fate, Before thou couldst great Charles his death relate. But what will deeper wound thy little mind, Hast left surviving Davenant still behind Who laughs to see in this thy death renew'd, Right Romane poverty and gratitude. Poor Poet thou, and grateful Senate they, Who thy last Reckoning did so largely pay. And with the publick gravity would come, When thou hadst drunk thy last to lead thee home. If that can be thy home where Spencer lyes And reverend Chaucer, but their dust does rise Against thee, and expels thee from their side, As th' Eagles Plumes from other birds divide. Nor here thy shade must dwell, Return, Return, Where Sulphrey Phlegeton does ever burn. The Cerberus with all his Jawes shall gnash, Megera thee with all her Serpents lash. Thou rivited unto Ixion's wheel Shalt break, and the perpetual Vulture feel. 'Tis just what Torments Poets ere did feign, Thou first Historically shouldst sustain. Thus by irrevocable Sentence cast, May only Master of these Revels past. And streight he vanisht in a Cloud of Pitch, Such as unto the Sabboth bears the Witch. A Poem upon the Death of His Late Highness the Lord Protector  That Providence which had so long the care Of Cromwell's head, and numbered every hair, Now in itself (the glass where all appears) Had seen the period of his golden years: And thenceforh only did attend to trace What death might least so fair a life deface.  The people, which what most they fear esteem, Death when more horrid, so more noble deem, And blame the last act, like spectators vain, Unless the prince whom they applaud be slain. Nor fate indeed can well refuse that right To those that lived in war, to die in fight.  But long his valour none had left that could Endanger him, or clemency that would. And he whom Nature all for peace had made, But angry heaven unto war had swayed, And so less useful where he most desired, For what he least affected was admired, Deservиd yet an end whose every part, Should speak the wondrous softness of his heart.  To Love and Grief the fatal writ was 'signed; (Those nobler weaknesses of human kind, From which those powers that issued the decree, Although immortal, found they were not free), That they, to whom his breast still open lies, In gentle passions should his death disguise: And leave succeeding ages cause to mourn, As long as Grief shall weep, or Love shall burn.  Straight does a slow and languishing disease Eliza, Nature's and his darling, seize. Her when an infant, taken with her charms, He oft would flourish in his mighty arms, And, lest their force the tender burden wrong, Slacken the vigour of his muscles strong; Then to the Mother's breast her softly move, Which while she drained of milk, she filled with love. But as with riper years her virtue grew, And every minute adds a lustre new, When with meridian height her beauty shined, And thorough that sparkled her fairer mind, When she with smiles serene in words discreet His hidden soul at ever turn could meet; Then might y'ha' daily his affection spied, Doubling that knot which destiny had tied, While they by sense, not knowing, comprehend How on each other both their fates depend. With her each day the pleasing hours he shares, And at her aspect calms his growing cares; Or with a grandsire's joy her children sees Hanging about her neck or at his knees. Hold fast, dear infants, hold them both or none; This will not stay when once the other's gone.  A silent fire now wastes those limbs of wax, And him within his tortured image racks. So the flower withering which the garden crowned, The sad root pines in secret under ground. Each groan he doubled and each sigh he sighed, Repeated over to the restless night. No trembling string composed to numbers new, Answers the touch in notes more sad, more true. She, lest he grieve, hides what she can her pains, And he to lessen hers his sorrow feigns: Yet both perceived, yet both concealed their skills, And so diminishing increased their ills: That whether by each other's grief they fell, Or on their own redoubled, none can tell.  And now Eliza's purple locks were shorn, Where she so long her Father's fate had worn: And frequent lightning to her soul that flies, Divides the air, and opens all the skies: And now his life, suspended by her breath, Ran out impetuously to hasting death. Like polished mirrors, so his steely breast Had every figure of her woes expressed, And with the damp of her last gasp obscured, Had drawn such stains as were not to be cured. Fate could not either reach with single stroke, But the dear image fled, the mirror broke.  Who now shall tell us more of mournful swans, Of halcyons kind, or bleeding pelicans? No downy breast did e'er so gently beat, Or fan with airy plumes so soft an heat. For he no duty by his height excused, Nor, though a prince, to be a man refused: But rather than in his Eliza's pain Not love, not grieve, would neither live nor reign: And in himself so oft immortal tried, Yet in compassion of another died.  So have I seen a vine, whose lasting age Of many a winter hath survived the rage, Under whose shady tent men every year At its rich blood's expense their sorrow cheer, If some dear branch where it extends its life Chance to be pruned by an untimely knife, The parent-tree unto the grief succeeds, And through the wound its vital humour bleeds, Trickling in watery drops, whose flowing shape Weeps that it falls ere fixed into a grape. So the dry stock, no more that spreading vine, Frustrates the autumn and the hopes of wine.  A secret cause does sure those signs ordain Foreboding princes' falls, and seldom vain. Whether some kinder powers that wish us well, What they above cannot prevent foretell; Or the great world do by consent presage, As hollow seas with future tempests rage; Or rather heaven, which us so long foresees, Their funerals celebrates while it decrees. But never yet was any human fate By Nature solemnized with so much state. He unconcerned the dreadful passage crossed; But, oh, what pangs that death did Nature cost!  First the great thunder was shot off, and sent The signal from the starry battlement. The winds receive it, and its force outdo, As practising how they could thunder too; Out of the binder's hand the sheaves they tore, And thrashed the harvest in the airy floor; Or of huge trees, whose growth with his did rise, The deep foundations opened to the skies. Then heavy show'rs the wingиd tempests lead, And pour the deluge o'er the chaos' head. The race of warlike horses at his tomb Offer themselves in many a hecatomb; With pensive head towards the ground they fall, And helpless languish at the tainted stall. Numbers of men decrease with pains unknown, And hasten, not to see his death, their own. Such tortures all the elements unfixed, Troubled to part where so exactly mixed. And as through air his wasting spirits flowed, The universe laboured beneath their load.  Nature, it seemed with him would Nature vie; He with Eliza. It with him would die, He without noise still travelled to his end, As silent suns to meet the night descend. The stars that for him fought had only power Left to determine now his final hour, Which, since they might not hinder, yet they cast To choose it worthy of his glories past.  No part of time but bare his mark away Of honour; all the year was Cromwell's day: But this, of all the most ausicious found, Twice had in open field him victor crowned: When up the armиd mountains of Dunbar He marched, and through deep Severn ending war. What day should him eternize but the same That had before immortalized his name? That so who ere would at his death have joyed, In their own griefs might find themselves employed; But those that sadly his departure grieved, Yet joyed, remebering what he once achieved. And the last minute his victorious ghost Gave chase to Ligny on the Belgic coast. Here ended all his mortal toils: he laid And slept in place under the laurel shade.  O Cromwell, Heaven's Favourite! To none Have such high honours from above been shown: For whom the elements we mourners see, And heaven itself would the great herald be, Which with more care set forth his obsequies Than those of Moses hid from human eyes, As jealous only here lest all be less, That we could to his memory express. Then let us to our course of mourning keep: Where heaven leads, 'tis piety to weep. Stand back, ye seas, and shrunk beneath the veil Of your abyss, with covered head bewail Your Monarch: we demand not your supplies To compass in our isle; our tears suffice: Since him away the dismal tempest rent, Who once more joined us to the continent; Who planted England on the Flandric shore, And stretched our frontier to the Indian ore; Whose greater truths obscure the fables old, Whether of British saints or Worthies told; And in a valour lessening Arthur's deeds, For holiness the Confessor exceeds.  He first put arms into Religion's hand, And timorous Conscience unto Courage manned: The soldier taught that inward mail to wear, And fearing God how they should nothing fear. `Those strokes,' he said, `will pierce through all below Where those that strike from heaven fetch their blow.' Astonished armies did their flight prepare, And cities strong were stormиd by his prayer; Of that, forever Preston's field shall tell The story, and impregnable Clonmel. And where the sandy mountain Fenwick scaled, The sea between, yet hence his prayer prevailed. What man was ever so in heaven obeyed Since the commanded sun o'er Gideon stayed? In all his wars needs must he triumph when He conquered God still ere he fought with men:  Hence, though in battle none so brave or fierce, Yet him the adverse steel could never pierce. Pity it seemed to hurt him more that felt Each wound himself which he to others dealt; Danger itself refusing to offend So loose an enemy, so fast a friend.  Friendship, that sacred virtue, long does claim The first foundation of his house and name: But within one its narrow limits fall, His tenderness extended unto all. And that deep soul through every channel flows, Where kindly nature loves itself to lose. More strong affections never reason served, Yet still affected most what best deserved. If he Eliza loved to that degree, (Though who more worthy to be loved than she?) If so indulgent to his own, how dear To him the children of the highest were? For her he once did nature's tribute pay: For these his life adventured every day: And 'twould be found, could we his thoughts have cast, Their griefs struck deepest, if Eliza's last.  What prudence more than human did he need To keep so dear, so differing minds agreed? The worser sort, as conscious of their ill, Lie weak and easy to the ruler's will; But to the good (too many or too few) All law is useless, all reward is due. Oh ill-advised, if not for love, for shame, Spare yet your own, if you neglect his fame; Lest others dare to think your zeal a mask, And you to govern, only heaven's task.  Valour, religion, friendship, prudence died At once with him, and all that's good beside; And we death's refuse, nature's dregs, confined To loathsome life, alas! are left behind. Where we (so once we used) shall now no more To fetch the day, press about his chamber door-- From which he issued with that awful state, It seemd Mars broke through Janus' double gate, Yet always tempered with an air so mild, No April suns that e'er so gently smiled-- No more shall hear that powerful language charm, Whose force oft spared the labour of his arm: No more shall follow where he spent the days In war, in counsel, or in prayer and praise, Whose meanest acts he would himself advance, As ungirt David to the ark did dance. All, all is gone of our or his delight In horses fierce, wild deer, or armour bright; Francisca fair can nothing now but weep, Nor with soft notes shall sing his cares asleep.  I saw him dead. A leaden slumber lies And mortal sleep over those wakeful eyes: Those gentle rays under the lids were fled, Which through his looks that piercing sweetness shed; That port which so majestic was and strong, Loose and deprived of vigour, stretched along: All withered, all discoloured, pale and wan-- How much another thing, nor more that man? Oh human glory vain, oh death, oh wings, Oh worthless world, oh transitory things!  Yet dwelt that greatnesss in his shape decayed, That still through dead, greater than death he laid: And in his altered face you something feign That threatens death he yet will live again.  Not much unlike the sacred oak which shoots To heaven its branches and through earth its roots, Whose spacious bought are hung with trophies round, And honoured wreaths have oft the victor crowned. When angry Jove darts lightning through the air, At mortals' sins, nor his own plant will spare, (It groans, and bruises all below, that stood So many years the shelter of the wood.) The tree erewhile foreshortened to our view, When fall'n shows taller yet than as it grew:  So shall his praise to after times increase, When truth shall be allowed, and faction cease, And his own shadows with him fall. The eye Detracts from object than itself more high: But when death takes them from that envied seat, Seeing how little, we confess how great.  Thee, many ages hence in martial verse Shall the English soldier, ere he charge, rehearse, Singing of thee, inflame themselves to fight, And with the name of Cromwell, armies fright. As long as rivers to the seas shall run, As long as Cynthia shall relieve the sun, While stags shall fly unto the firests thick, While sheep delight the grassy downs to pick, As long as future times succeeds the past, Always they honour, praise, and name shall last.  Thou in a pitch how far beyond the sphere Of human glory tower'st, and reigning there Despoiled of mortal robes, in seas of bliss, Plunging dost bathe, and tread the bright abyss: There thy great soul yet once a world does see, Spacious enough, and pure enough for thee. How soon thou Moses hast, and Joshua found, And David for the sword and harp renowned? How straight canst to each happy mansion go? (Far better known above than here below) And in those joys dost spend the endless day, Which in expressing we ourselves betray.  For we, since thou art gone, with heavy doom, Wander like ghosts about thy lovиd tomb; And lost in tears, have neither sight nor mind To guide us upward through this region blind. Since thou art gone, who best that way couldst teach, Only our sighs, perhaps, may thither reach.  And Richard yet, where his great parent led, Beats on the rugged track: he, virtue dead, Revives, and by his milder beams assures; And yet how much of them his grief obscures?  He, as his father, long was kept from sight In private, to be viewed by better light; But opened once, what splendour does he throw? A Cromwell in an hour a prince will grow. How he becomes that seat, how strongly strains, How gently winds at once the ruling reins? Heaven to this choice prepared a diadem, Richer than any Easter silk or gem; A pearly rainbow, where the sun enchased His brows, like an imperial jewel graced.  We find already what those omens mean, Earth ne'er more glad, nor heaven more serene. Cease now our griefs, calm peace succeeds a war, Rainbows to storms, Richard to Oliver. Tempt not his clemency to try his power, He threats no deluge, yet foretells a shower. See with what simplicity This Nimph begins her golden daies! In the green Grass she loves to lie, And there with her fair Aspect tames The Wilder flow'rs, and gives them names: But only with the Roses playes; And them does tell What Colour best becomes them, and what Smell.  Who can foretel for what high cause This Darling of the Gods was born! Yet this is She whose chaster Laws The wanton Love shall one day fear, And, under her command severe, See his Bow broke and Ensigns torn. Happy, who can Appease this virtuous Enemy of Man!  O then let me in time compound, And parly with those conquering Eyes; Ere they have try'd their force to wound, Ere, with their glancing wheels, they drive In Triumph over Hearts that strive, And them that yield but more despise. Let me be laid, Where I may see thy Glories from some Shade.  Mean time, whilst every verdant thing It self does at thy Beauty charm, Reform the errours of the Spring; Make that the Tulips may have share Of sweetness, seeing they are fair; And Roses of their thorns disarm: But most procure That Violets may a longer Age endure.  But O young beauty of the Woods, Whom Nature courts with fruits and flow'rs, Gather the Flow'rs, but spare the Buds; Lest Flora angry at thy crime, To kill her Infants in their prime, Do quickly make th' Example Yours; And, ere we see, Nip in the blossome all our hopes and Thee. See here an easy feast that knows no wound, That under hunger's teeth will needs be sound; A subtle harvest of unbounded bread, What would ye more? Here food itself is fed. LOVE, thou are absolute, sole Lord Of life and death. To prove the word, We'll now appeal to none of all Those thy old soldiers, great and tall, Ripe men of martyrdom, that could reach down With strong arms their triumphant crown: Such as could with lusty breath Speak loud, unto the face of death, Their great Lord's glorious name; to none Of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne For love at large to fill. Spare blood and sweat: We'll see Him take a private seat, And make His mansion in the mild And milky soul of a soft child. Scarce has she learnt to lisp a name Of martyr, yet she thinks it shame Life should so long play with that breath Which spent can buy so brave a death. She never undertook to know What death with love should have to do. Nor has she e'er yet understood Why, to show love, she should shed blood; Yet, though she cannot tell you why, She can love, and she can die. Scarce has she blood enough to make A guilty sword blush for her sake; Yet has a heart dares hope to prove How much less strong is death than love....  Since 'tis not to be had at home, She'll travel for a martyrdom. No home for her, confesses she, But where she may a martyr be. She'll to the Moors, and trade with them For this unvalued diadem; She offers them her dearest breath, With Christ's name in 't, in charge for death: She'll bargain with them, and will give Them God, and teach them how to live In Him; or, if they this deny, For Him she'll teach them how to die. So shall she leave amongst them sown Her Lord's blood, or at least her own.  Farewell then, all the world, adieu! Teresa is no more for you. Farewell all pleasures, sports, and joys, Never till now esteemed toys!  Farewell whatever dear may be-- Mother's arms, or father's knee! Farewell house, and farewell home! She 's for the Moors and Martyrdom.  Sweet, not so fast; lo! thy fair spouse, Whom thou seek'st with so swift vows, Calls thee back, and bids thee come T' embrace a milder martyrdom....  O how oft shalt thou complain Of a sweet and subtle pain! Of intolerable joys! Of a death, in which who dies Loves his death, and dies again, And would for ever so be slain; And lives and dies, and knows not why To live, but that he still may die! How kindly will thy gentle heart Kiss the sweetly-killing dart! And close in his embraces keep Those delicious wounds, that weep Balsam, to heal themselves with thus, When these thy deaths, so numerous, Shall all at once die into one, And melt thy soul's sweet mansion; Like a soft lump of incense, hasted By too hot a fire, and wasted Into perfuming clouds, so fast Shalt thou exhale to heaven at last In a resolving sigh, and then,-- O what? Ask not the tongues of men.  Angels cannot tell; suffice, Thyself shalt feel thine own full joys, And hold them fast for ever there. So soon as thou shalt first appear, The moon of maiden stars, thy white Mistress, attended by such bright Souls as thy shining self, shall come, And in her first ranks make thee room; Where, 'mongst her snowy family, Immortal welcomes wait for thee. O what delight, when she shall stand And teach thy lips heaven, with her hand, On which thou now may'st to thy wishes Heap up thy consecrated kisses! What joy shall seize thy soul, when she, Bending her blessed eyes on thee, Those second smiles of heaven, shall dart Her mild rays through thy melting heart!  Angels, thy old friends, there shall greet thee, Glad at their own home now to meet thee. All thy good works which went before, And waited for thee at the door, Shall own thee there; and all in one Weave a constellation Of crowns, with which the King, thy spouse, Shall build up thy triumphant brows. All thy old woes shall now smile on thee, And thy pains sit bright upon thee: All thy sorrows here shall shine, And thy sufferings be divine. Tears shall take comfort, and turn gems, And wrongs repent to diadems. Even thy deaths shall live, and new Dress the soul which late they slew. Thy wounds shall blush to such bright scars As keep account of the Lamb's wars.  Those rare works, where thou shalt leave writ Love's noble history, with wit Taught thee by none but Him, while here They feed our souls, shall clothe thine there. Each heavenly word by whose hid flame Our hard hearts shall strike fire, the same Shall flourish on thy brows, and be Both fire to us and flame to thee; Whose light shall live bright in thy face By glory, in our hearts by grace. Thou shalt look round about, and see Thousands of crown'd souls throng to be Themselves thy crown, sons of thy vows, The virgin-births with which thy spouse Made fruitful thy fair soul; go now, And with them all about thee bow To Him; put on, He'll say, put on, My rosy Love, that thy rich zone, Sparkling with the sacred flames Of thousand souls, whose happy names Heaven keeps upon thy score: thy bright Life brought them first to kiss the light That kindled them to stars; and so Thou with the Lamb, thy Lord, shalt go. And, wheresoe'er He sets His white Steps, walk with Him those ways of light, Which who in death would live to see, Must learn in life to die like thee. Thou water turn'st to wine, fair friend of life, Thy foe, to cross the sweet arts of thy reign, Distills from thence the tears of wrath and strife, And so turns wine to water back again. The world's light shines, shine as it will, The world will love its darkness still. I doubt though when the world's in hell, It will not love its darkness half so well. I sing the Name which None can say But touch’t with An interiour Ray: The Name of our New Peace; our Good: Our Blisse: and Supernaturall Blood: The Name of All our Lives and Loves. Hearken, And Help, ye holy Doves! The high-born Brood of Day; you bright Candidates of blissefull Light, The Heirs Elect of Love; whose Names belong Unto The everlasting life of Song; All ye wise Soules, who in the wealthy Brest Of This unbounded Name build your warm Nest. Awake, My glory. Soul, (if such thou be, And That fair Word at all referr to Thee) Awake and sing And be All Wing; Bring hither thy whole Self; and let me see What of thy Parent Heaven yet speakes in thee, O thou art Poore Of noble Powres, I see, And full of nothing else but empty Me, Narrow, and low, and infinitely lesse Then this Great mornings mighty Busynes. One little World or two (Alas) will never doe. We must have store. Goe, Soul, out of thy Self, and seek for More. Goe and request Great Nature for the Key of her huge Chest Of Heavns, the self involving Sett of Sphears (Which dull mortality more Feeles then heares) Then rouse the nest Of nimble, Art, and traverse round The Aiery Shop of soul-appeasing Sound: And beat a summons in the Same All-soveraign Name To warn each severall kind And shape of sweetnes, Be they such As sigh with supple wind Or answer Artfull Touch, That they convene and come away To wait at the love-crowned Doores of This Illustrious Day. Shall we dare This, my Soul? we’l doe’t and bring No Other note for’t, but the Name we sing. Wake Lute and Harp And every sweet-lipp’t Thing That talkes with tunefull string; Start into life, And leap with me Into a hasty Fitt-tun’d Harmony. Nor must you think it much T’obey my bolder touch; I have Authority in Love’s name to take you And to the worke of Love this morning wake you; Wake; In the Name Of Him who never sleeps, All Things that Are, Or, what’s the same, Are Musicall; Answer my Call And come along; Help me to meditate mine Immortall Song. Come, ye soft ministers of sweet sad mirth, Bring All your houshold stuffe of Heavn on earth; O you, my Soul’s most certain Wings, Complaining Pipes, and prattling Strings, Bring All the store Of Sweets you have; And murmur that you have no more. Come, nй to part, Nature and Art! Come; and come strong, To the conspiracy of our Spatious song. Bring All the Powres of Praise Your Provinces of well-united Worlds can raise; Bring All your Lutes and Harps of Heaven and Earth; What йre cooperates to The common mirthe Vessells of vocall Ioyes, Or You, more noble Architects of Intellectuall Noise, Cymballs of Heav’n, or Humane sphears, Solliciters of Soules or Eares; And when you’are come, with All That you can bring or we can call; O may you fix For ever here, and mix Your selves into the long And everlasting series of a deathlesse Song; Mix All your many Worlds, Above, And loose them into One of Love. Chear thee my Heart! For Thou too hast thy Part And Place in the Great Throng Of This unbounded All-imbracing Song. Powres of my Soul, be Proud! And speake lowd To All the dear-bought Nations This Redeeming Name, And in the wealth of one Rich Word proclaim New Similes to Nature. May it be no wrong Blest Heavns, to you, and your Superiour song, That we, dark Sons of Dust and Sorrow, A while Dare borrow The Name of Your Dilights and our Desires, And fitt it to so farr inferior Lyres. Our Murmurs have their Musick too, Ye mighty Orbes, as well as you, Nor yeilds the noblest Nest Of warbling Seraphim to the eares of Love, A choicer Lesson then the joyfull Brest Of a poor panting Turtle-Dove. And we, low Wormes have leave to doe The Same bright Busynes (ye Third Heavens) with you. Gentle Spirits, doe not complain. We will have care To keep it fair, And send it back to you again. Come, lovely Name! Appeare from forth the Bright Regions of peacefull Light, Look from thine own Illustrious Home, Fair King of Names, and come. Leave All thy native Glories in their Georgeous Nest, And give thy Self a while The gracious Guest Of humble Soules, that seek to find The hidden Sweets Which man’s heart meets When Thou art Master of the Mind. Come, lovely Name; life of our hope! Lo we hold our Hearts wide ope! Unlock thy Cabinet of Day Dearest Sweet, and come away. Lo how the thirsty Lands Gasp for thy Golden Showres! with longstretch’t Hands. Lo how the laboring Earth That hopes to be All Heaven by Thee, Leapes at thy Birth. The’ attending World, to wait thy Rise, First turn’d to eyes; And then, not knowing what to doe; Turn’d Them to Teares, and spent Them too. Come Royall Name, and pay the expence Of all this Pretious Patience. O come away And kill the Death of This Delay. O see, so many Worlds of barren yeares Melted and measur’d out is Seas of Teares. O see, The Weary liddes of wakefull Hope (Love’s Eastern windowes) All wide ope With Curtains drawn, To catch The Day-break of Thy Dawn. O dawn, at last, long look’t for Day! Take thine own wings, and come away. Lo, where Aloft it comes! It comes, Among The Conduct of Adoring Spirits, that throng Like diligent Bees, And swarm about it. O they are wise; And know what Sweetes are suck’t from out it. It is the Hive, By which they thrive, Where All their Hoard of Hony lyes. Lo where it comes, upon The snowy Dove’s Soft Back; And brings a Bosom big with Loves. Welcome to our dark world, Thou Womb of Day! Unfold thy fair Conceptions; And display The Birth of our Bright Ioyes. O thou compacted Body of Blessings: spirit of Soules extracted! O dissipate thy spicy Powres (Clowd of condensed sweets) and break upon us In balmy showrs; O fill our senses, And take from us All force of so Prophane a Fallacy To think ought sweet but that which smells of Thee. Fair, flowry Name; In none but Thee And Thy Nectareall Fragrancy, Hourly there meetes An universall Synod of All sweets; By whom it is defined Thus That no Perfume For ever shall presume To passe for Odoriferous, But such alone whose sacred Pedigree Can prove it Self some kin (sweet name) to Thee. Sweet Name, in Thy each Syllable A Thousand Blest Arabias dwell; A Thousand Hills of Frankincense; Mountains of myrrh, and Beds of species, And ten Thousand Paradises, The soul that tasts thee takes from thence. How many unknown Worlds there are Of Comforts, which Thou hast in keeping! How many Thousand Mercyes there In Pitty’s soft lap ly a sleeping! Happy he who has the art To awake them, And to take them Home, and lodge them in his Heart. O that it were as it was wont to be! When thy old Freinds of Fire, All full of Thee, Fought against Frowns with smiles; gave Glorious chase To Persecutions; And against the Face Of Death and feircest Dangers, durst with Brave And sober pace march on to meet A Grave. On their Bold Brests about the world they bore thee And to the Teeth of Hell stood up to teach thee, In Center of their inmost Soules they wore thee, Where Rackes and Torments striv’d, in vain, to reach thee. Little, alas, thought They Who tore the Fair Brests of thy Freinds, Their Fury but made way For Thee; And serv’d them in Thy glorious ends. What did Their weapons but with wider pores Inlarge thy flaming-brested Lovers More freely to transpire That impatient Fire The Heart that hides Thee hardly covers. What did their Weapons but sett wide the Doores For Thee: Fair, purple Doores, of love’s devising; The Ruby windowes which inrich’t the East Of Thy so oft repeated Rising. Each wound of Theirs was Thy new Morning; And reinthron’d thee in thy Rosy Nest, With blush of thine own Blood thy day adorning, It was the witt of love уreflowd the Bounds Of Wrath, and made thee way through All Those wounds. Wellcome dear, All-Adored Name! For sure there is no Knee That knowes not Thee. Or if there be such sonns of shame, Alas what will they doe When stubborn Rocks shall bow And Hills hang down their Heavn-saluting Heads To seek for humble Beds Of Dust, where in the Bashfull shades of night Next to their own low Nothing they may ly, And couch before the dazeling light of thy dread majesty. They that by Love’s mild Dictate now Will not adore thee, Shall Then with Just Confusion, bow And break before thee. TO these whom death again did wed This grave 's the second marriage-bed. For though the hand of Fate could force 'Twixt soul and body a divorce, It could not sever man and wife, Because they both lived but one life. Peace, good reader, do not weep; Peace, the lovers are asleep. They, sweet turtles, folded lie In the last knot that love could tie. Let them sleep, let them sleep on, Till the stormy night be gone, And the eternal morrow dawn; Then the curtains will be drawn, And they wake into a light Whose day shall never die in night. Since that I may not have Love on this side the grave, Let me imagine Love. Since not mine is the bliss Of 'claspt hands and lips that kiss,' Let me in dreams it prove. What tho' as the years roll No soul shall melt to my soul, Let me conceive such thing; Tho' never shall entwine Loving arms around mine Let dreams caresses bring. To live--it is my doom-- Lonely as in a tomb, This cross on me was laid; My God, I know not why; Here in the dark I lie, Lonely, yet not afraid. It has seemed good to Thee Still to withhold the key Which opes the way to men; I am shut in alone, I make not any moan, Thy ways are past my ken. Yet grant me this, to find The sweetness in my mind Which I must still forego; Great God which art above, Grant me to image Love,-- The bliss without the woe. So stick up ivy and the bays, And then restore the heathen ways. Green will remind you of the spring, Though this great day denies the thing. And mortifies the earth and all But your wild revels, and loose hall. Could you wear flowers, and roses strow Blushing upon your breasts' warm snow, That very dress your lightness will Rebuke, and wither at the ill. The brightness of this day we owe Not unto music, masque, nor show: Nor gallant furniture, nor plate; But to the manger's mean estate. His life while here, as well as birth, Was but a check to pomp and mirth; And all man's greatness you may see Condemned by His humility. Then leave your open house and noise, To welcome Him with holy joys, And the poor shepherd's watchfulness: Whom light and hymns from heaven did bless. What you abound with, cast abroad To those that want, and ease your load. Who empties thus, will bring more in; But riot is both loss and sin. Dress finely what comes not in sight, And then you keep your Christmas right.  With what deep murmurs through time's silent stealth  Doth thy transparent, cool, and wat'ry wealth  Here flowing fall,  And chide, and call,  As if his liquid, loose retinue stay'd  Ling'ring, and were of this steep place afraid;  The common pass  Where, clear as glass,  All must descend  Not to an end,  But quicken'd by this deep and rocky grave,  Rise to a longer course more bright and brave.   Dear stream! dear bank, where often I  Have sate and pleas'd my pensive eye,  Why, since each drop of thy quick store  Runs thither whence it flow'd before,  Should poor souls fear a shade or night,  Who came, sure, from a sea of light?  Or since those drops are all sent back  So sure to thee, that none doth lack,  Why should frail flesh doubt any more  That what God takes, he'll not restore?   O useful element and clear!  My sacred wash and cleanser here,  My first consigner unto those  Fountains of life where the Lamb goes!  What sublime truths and wholesome themes  Lodge in thy mystical deep streams!  Such as dull man can never find  Unless that Spirit lead his mind  Which first upon thy face did move,  And hatch'd all with his quick'ning love.  As this loud brook's incessant fall  In streaming rings restagnates all,  Which reach by course the bank, and then  Are no more seen, just so pass men.  O my invisible estate,  My glorious liberty, still late!  Thou art the channel my soul seeks,  Not this with cataracts and creeks. Hail sacred shades! cool, leavy House! Chaste treasurer of all my vows, And wealth! on whose soft bosom laid My love's fair steps I first betrayed: Henceforth no melancholy flight, No sad wing, or hoarse bird of night, Disturb this air, no fatal throat Of raven, or owl, awake the note Of our laid echo, no voice dwell Within these leaves, but Philomel. The poisonous ivy here no more His false twists on the oak shall score, Only the woodbine here may twine As th'emblem of her love and mine; Th'amorous sun shall here convey His best beams, in thy shades to play; The active air, the gentlest showers Shall from his wings rain on thy flowers; And the moon from her dewy locks Shall deck thee with her brightest drops: What ever can a fancy move, Or feed the eye; be on this Grove; And when at last the winds and tears Of Heaven, with the consuming years, Shall these green curls bring to decay, And clothe thee in an aged gray: (If ought a lover can foresee; Or if we poets, prophets be) From hence transplant'd, thou shalt stand A fresh Grove in th'Elysian land; Where (most blest pair!) as here on earth Thou first didst eye our growth and birth; So there again, thou'lt see us move In our first innocence, and love: And in thy shades, as now, so then, We'll kiss, and smile, and walk again. Why should such gloomy silence reign; And why is all the house so drear, When neither danger, sickness, pain, Nor death, nor want have entered here? We are as many as we were That other night, when all were gay, And full of hope, and free from care; Yet, is there something gone away.  The moon without as pure and calm Is shining as that night she shone; but now, to us she brings no balm, For something from our hearts is gone.  Something whose absence leaves a void, A cheerless want in every heart. Each feels the bliss of all destroyed And mourns the change - but each apart.  The fire is burning in the grate As redly as it used to burn, But still the hearth is desolate Till Mirth and Love with Peace return.  'Twas Peace that flowed from heart to heart With looks and smiles that spoke of Heaven, And gave us language to impart The blissful thoughts itself had given.  Sweet child of Heaven, and joy of earth! O, when will Man thy value learn? We rudely drove thee from our hearth, And vainly sigh for thy return. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are ! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky.  When the blazing sun is gone, When he nothing shines upon, Then you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.  Then the trav'ller in the dark, Thanks you for your tiny spark, He could not see which way to go, If you did not twinkle so.  In the dark blue sky you keep, And often thro' my curtains peep, For you never shut your eye, Till the sun is in the sky.  'Tis your bright and tiny spark, Lights the trav'ller in the dark : Tho' I know not what you are, Twinkle, twinkle, little star. O, let me be alone a while, No human form is nigh. And may I sing and muse aloud, No mortal ear is by. Away! ye dreams of earthly bliss, Ye earthly cares begone: Depart! ye restless wandering thoughts, And let me be alone!  One hour, my spirit, stretch thy wings, And quit this joyless sod, Bask in the sunshine of the sky, And be alone with God! O thou Most High who rulest all And hear'st the prayers of thine, O hearken, Lord, unto my suit And my petition sign.  Into Thy everlasting arms Of mercy I commend Thy servant, Lord. Keep and preserve My husband, my dear friend.  At Thy command, O Lord, he went, Nor nought could keep him back. Then let Thy promise joy his heart, O help and be not slack.  Uphold my heart in Thee, O God. Thou art my strength and stay, Thou see'st how weak and frail I am, Hide not Thy face away.  I in obedience to Thy will Thou knowest did submit. It was my duty so to do; O Lord, accept of it.  Unthankfulness for mercies past Impute Thou not to me. O Lord, Thou know'st my weak desire Was to sing praise to Thee.  Lord, be Thou pilot to the ship And send them prosperous gales. In storms and sickness, Lord, preserve. Thy goodness never fails.  Unto Thy work he hath in hand Lord, grant Thou good success And favour in their eyes to whom He shall make his address.  Remember, Lord, Thy folk whom Thou To wilderness hast brought; Let not Thine own inheritance Be sold away for nought.  But tokens of Thy favour give, With joy send back my dear That I and all Thy servants may Rejoice with heavenly cheer.  Lord, let my eyes see once again Him whom Thou gavest me That we together may sing praise Forever unto Thee.  And the remainder of our days Shall consecrated be With an engaged heart to sing All praises unto Thee. Most truly honoured, and as truly dear, If worth in me or ought I do appear, Who can of right better demand the same Than may your worthy self from whom it came? The principal might yield a greater sum, Yet handled ill, amounts but to this crumb; My stock's so small I know not how to pay, My bond remains in force unto this day; Yet for part payment take this simple mite, Where nothing's to be had, kings loose their right. Such is my debt I may not say forgive, But as I can, I'll pay it while I live; Such is my bond, none can discharge but I, Yet paying is not paid until I die. All things within this fading world hath end, Adversity doth still our joys attend; No ties so strong, no friends so dear and sweet, But with death's parting blow are sure to meet. The sentence past is most irrevocable, A common thing, yet oh, inevitable. How soon, my Dear, death may my steps attend, How soon't may be thy lot to lose thy friend, We both are ignorant, yet love bids me These farewell lines to recommend to thee, That when the knot's untied that made us one, I may seem thine, who in effect am none. And if I see not half my days that's due, What nature would, God grant to yours and you; The many faults that well you know I have Let be interred in my oblivious grave; If any worth or virtue were in me, Let that live freshly in thy memory And when thou feel'st no grief, as I no harmes, Yet love thy dead, who long lay in thine arms, And when thy loss shall be repaid with gains Look to my little babes, my dear remains. And if thou love thyself, or loved'st me, These O protect from stepdame's injury. And if chance to thine eyes shall bring this verse, With some sad sighs honor my absent hearse; And kiss this paper for thy dear love's sake, Who with salt tears this last farewell did take. If ever two were one, then surely we. If ever man were lov'd by wife, then thee. If ever wife was happy in a man, Compare with me, ye women, if you can. I prize thy love more than whole Mines of gold Or all the riches that the East doth hold. My love is such that Rivers cannot quench, Nor ought but love from thee give recompetence. Thy love is such I can no way repay. The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray. Then while we live, in love let's so persever That when we live no more, we may live ever. I had eight birds hatched in one nest, Four cocks there were, and hens the rest. I nursed them up with pain and care, Nor cost, nor labour did I spare, Till at the last they felt their wing, Mounted the trees, and learned to sing; Chief of the brood then took his flight To regions far and left me quite. My mournful chirps I after send, Till he return, or I do end: Leave not thy nest, thy dam and sire, Fly back and sing amidst this choir. My second bird did take her flight, And with her mate flew out of sight; Southward they both their course did bend, And seasons twain they there did spend, Till after blown by southern gales, They norward steered with filled sails. A prettier bird was no where seen, Along the beach among the treen. I have a third of colour white, On whom I placed no small delight; Coupled with mate loving and true, Hath also bid her dam adieu; And where Aurora first appears, She now hath perched to spend her years. One to the academy flew To chat among that learned crew; Ambition moves still in his breast That he might chant above the rest Striving for more than to do well, That nightingales he might excel. My fifth, whose down is yet scarce gone, Is 'mongst the shrubs and bushes flown, And as his wings increase in strength, On higher boughs he'll perch at length. My other three still with me nest, Until they're grown, then as the rest, Or here or there they'll take their flight, As is ordained, so shall they light. If birds could weep, then would my tears Let others know what are my fears Lest this my brood some harm should catch, And be surprised for want of watch, Whilst pecking corn and void of care, They fall un'wares in fowler's snare, Or whilst on trees they sit and sing, Some untoward boy at them do fling, Or whilst allured with bell and glass, The net be spread, and caught, alas. Or lest by lime-twigs they be foiled, Or by some greedy hawks be spoiled. O would my young, ye saw my breast, And knew what thoughts there sadly rest, Great was my pain when I you fed, Long did I keep you soft and warm, And with my wings kept off all harm, My cares are more and fears than ever, My throbs such now as 'fore were never. Alas, my birds, you wisdom want, Of perils you are ignorant; Oft times in grass, on trees, in flight, Sore accidents on you may light. O to your safety have an eye, So happy may you live and die. Meanwhile my days in tunes I'll spend, Till my weak lays with me shall end. In shady woods I'll sit and sing, And things that past to mind I'll bring. Once young and pleasant, as are you, But former toys (no joys) adieu. My age I will not once lament, But sing, my time so near is spent. And from the top bough take my flight Into a country beyond sight, Where old ones instantly grow young, And there with seraphims set song; No seasons cold, nor storms they see; But spring lasts to eternity. When each of you shall in your nest Among your young ones take your rest, In chirping language, oft them tell, You had a dam that loved you well, That did what could be done for young, And nursed you up till you were strong, And 'fore she once would let you fly, She showed you joy and misery; Taught what was good, and what was ill, What would save life, and what would kill. Thus gone, amongst you I may live, And dead, yet speak, and counsel give: Farewell, my birds, farewell adieu, I happy am, if well with you. Absent upon Public Employment  My head, my heart, mine eyes, my life, nay more, My joy, my magazine, of earthly store, If two be one, as surely thou and I, How stayest thou there, whilst I at Ipswich lie? So many steps, head from the heart to sever, If but a neck, soon should we be together. I, like the Earth this season, mourn in black, My Sun is gone so far in's zodiac, Whom whilst I 'joyed, nor storms, nor frost I felt, His warmth such fridged colds did cause to melt. My chilled limbs now numbed lie forlorn; Return; return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn; In this dead time, alas, what can I more Than view those fruits which through thy heart I bore? Which sweet contentment yield me for a space, True living pictures of their father's face. O strange effect! now thou art southward gone, I weary grow the tedious day so long; But when thou northward to me shalt return, I wish my Sun may never set, but burn Within the Cancer of my glowing breast, The welcome house of him my dearest guest. Where ever, ever stay, and go not thence, Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence; Flesh of thy flesh, bone of thy bone, I here, thou there, yet both but one. . Lo now! four other acts upon the stage, . Childhood, and Youth, the Manly, and Old-age. . The first: son unto Phlegm, grand-child to water, . Unstable, supple, moist, and cold's his Nature. . The second: frolic claims his pedigree; . From blood and air, for hot and moist is he. . The third of fire and choler is compos'd, . Vindicative, and quarrelsome dispos'd. . The last, of earth and heavy melancholy, . Solid, hating all lightness, and all folly. . Childhood was cloth'd in white, and given to show, . His spring was intermixed with some snow. . Upon his head a Garland Nature set: . Of Daisy, Primrose, and the Violet. . Such cold mean flowers (as these) blossom betime, . Before the Sun hath throughly warm'd the clime. . His hobby striding, did not ride, but run, . And in his hand an hour-glass new begun, . In dangers every moment of a fall, . And when 'tis broke, then ends his life and all. . But if he held till it have run its last, . Then may he live till threescore years or past. . Next, youth came up in gorgeous attire . (As that fond age, doth most of all desire), . His Suit of Crimson, and his Scarf of Green. . In's countenance, his pride quickly was seen. . Garland of Roses, Pinks, and Gillyflowers . Seemed to grow on's head (bedew'd with showers). . His face as fresh, as is Aurora fair, . When blushing first, she 'gins to red the Air. . No wooden horse, but one of metal try'd: . He seems to fly, or swim, and not to ride. . Then prancing on the Stage, about he wheels; . But as he went, death waited at his heels. . The next came up, in a more graver sort, . As one that cared for a good report. . His Sword by's side, and choler in his eyes, . But neither us'd (as yet) for he was wise, . Of Autumn fruits a basket on his arm, . His golden rod in's purse, which was his charm. . And last of all, to act upon this Stage, . Leaning upon his staff, comes up old age. . Under his arm a Sheaf of wheat he bore, . A Harvest of the best: what needs he more? . In's other hand a glass, ev'n almost run, . This writ about: This out, then I am done. . His hoary hairs and grave aspect made way, . And all gave ear to what he had to say. . These being met, each in his equipage . Intend to speak, according to their age, . But wise Old-age did with all gravity . To childish childhood give precedency, . And to the rest, his reason mildly told: . That he was young, before he grew so old. . To do as he, the rest full soon assents, . Their method was that of the Elements, . That each should tell what of himself he knew, . Both good and bad, but yet no more then's true. . With heed now stood, three ages of frail man, . To hear the child, who crying, thus began.  Childhood.  . Ah me! conceiv'd in sin, and born in sorrow, . A nothing, here to day, but gone to morrow, . Whose mean beginning, blushing can't reveal, . But night and darkness must with shame conceal. . My mother's breeding sickness, I will spare, . Her nine months' weary burden not declare. . To shew her bearing pangs, I should do wrong, . To tell that pain, which can't be told by tongue. . With tears into this world I did arrive; . My mother still did waste, as I did thrive, . Who yet with love and all alacity, . Spending was willing to be spent for me. . With wayward cries, I did disturb her rest, . Who sought still to appease me with her breast; . With weary arms, she danc'd, and By, By, sung, . When wretched I (ungrate) had done the wrong. . When Infancy was past, my Childishness . Did act all folly that it could express. . My silliness did only take delight, . In that which riper age did scorn and slight, . In Rattles, Bables, and such toyish stuff. . My then ambitious thoughts were low enough. . My high-born soul so straitly was confin'd . That its own worth it did not know nor mind. . This little house of flesh did spacious count, . Through ignorance, all troubles did surmount, . Yet this advantage had mine ignorance, . Freedom from Envy and from Arrogance. . How to be rich, or great, I did not cark, . A Baron or a Duke ne'r made my mark, . Nor studious was, Kings favours how to buy, . With costly presents, or base flattery; . No office coveted, wherein I might . Make strong my self and turn aside weak right. . No malice bare to this or that great Peer, . Nor unto buzzing whisperers gave ear. . I gave no hand, nor vote, for death, of life. . I'd nought to do, 'twixt Prince, and peoples' strife. . No Statist I: nor Marti'list i' th' field. . Where e're I went, mine innocence was shield. . My quarrels, not for Diadems, did rise, . But for an Apple, Plumb, or some such prize. . My strokes did cause no death, nor wounds, nor scars. . My little wrath did cease soon as my wars. . My duel was no challenge, nor did seek. . My foe should weltering, with his bowels reek. . I had no Suits at law, neighbours to vex, . Nor evidence for land did me perplex. . I fear'd no storms, nor all the winds that blows. . I had no ships at Sea, no fraughts to loose. . I fear'd no drought, nor wet; I had no crop, . Nor yet on future things did place my hope. . This was mine innocence, but oh the seeds . Lay raked up of all the cursed weeds, . Which sprouted forth in my insuing age, . As he can tell, that next comes on the stage. . But yet me let me relate, before I go, . The sins and dangers I am subject to: . From birth stained, with Adam's sinful fact, . From thence I 'gan to sin, as soon as act; . A perverse will, a love to what's forbid; . A serpent's sting in pleasing face lay hid; . A lying tongue as soon as it could speak . And fifth Commandment do daily break; . Oft stubborn, peevish, sullen, pout, and cry; . Then nought can please, and yet I know not why. . As many was my sins, so dangers too, . For sin brings sorrow, sickness, death, and woe, . And though I miss the tossings of the mind, . Yet griefs in my frail flesh I still do find. . What gripes of wind, mine infancy did pain? . What tortures I, in breeding teeth sustain? . What crudities my cold stomach hath bred? . Whence vomits, worms, and flux have issued? . What breaches, knocks, and falls I daily have? . And some perhaps, I carry to my grave. . Sometimes in fire, sometimes in water fall: . Strangely preserv'd, yet mind it not at all. . At home, abroad, my danger's manifold . That wonder 'tis, my glass till now doth hold. . I've done: unto my elders I give way, . For 'tis but little that a child can say.  Youth.   . My goodly clothing and beauteous skin . Declare some greater riches are within, . But what is best I'll first present to view, . And then the worst, in a more ugly hue, . For thus to do we on this Stage assemble, . Then let not him, which hath most craft dissemble. . Mine education, and my learning's such, . As might my self, and others, profit much: . With nurture trained up in virtue's Schools; . Of Science, Arts, and Tongues, I know the rules; . The manners of the Court, I likewise know, . Nor ignorant what they in Country do. . The brave attempts of valiant Knights I prize . That dare climb Battlements, rear'd to the skies. . The snorting Horse, the Trumpet, Drum I like, . The glist'ring Sword, and well advanced Pike. . I cannot lie in trench before a Town, . Nor wait til good advice our hopes do crown. . I scorn the heavy Corslet, Musket-proof; . I fly to catch the Bullet that's aloof. . Though thus in field, at home, to all most kind, . So affable that I do suit each mind, . I can insinuate into the breast . And by my mirth can raise the heart deprest. . Sweet Music rapteth my harmonious Soul, . And elevates my thoughts above the Pole. . My wit, my bounty, and my courtesy . Makes all to place their future hopes on me. . This is my best, but youth (is known) alas, . To be as wild as is the snuffing Ass, . As vain as froth, as vanity can be, . That who would see vain man may look on me: . My gifts abus'd, my education lost, . My woful Parents' longing hopes all crost; . My wit evaporates in merriment; . My valour in some beastly quarrel's spent; . Martial deeds I love not, 'cause they're virtuous, . But doing so, might seem magnanimous. . My Lust doth hurry me to all that's ill, . I know no Law, nor reason, but my will; . Sometimes lay wait to take a wealthy purse . Or stab the man in's own defence, that's worse. . Sometimes I cheat (unkind) a female Heir . Of all at once, who not so wise, as fair, . Trusteth my loving looks and glozing tongue . Until her friends, treasure, and honour's gone. . Sometimes I sit carousing others' health . Until mine own be gone, my wit, and wealth. . From pipe to pot, from pot to words and blows, . For he that loveth Wine wanteth no woes. . Days, nights, with Ruffins, Roarers, Fiddlers spend, . To all obscenity my ears I bend, . All counsel hate which tends to make me wise, . And dearest friends count for mine enemies. . If any care I take, 'tis to be fine, . For sure my suit more than my virtues shine. . If any time from company I spare, . 'Tis spent in curling, frisling up my hair, . Some young Adonais I do strive to be. . Sardana Pallas now survives in me. . Cards, Dice, and Oaths, concomitant, I love; . To Masques, to Plays, to Taverns still I move; . And in a word, if what I am you'd hear, . Seek out a British, bruitish Cavalier. . Such wretch, such monster am I; but yet more . I want a heart all this for to deplore. . Thus, thus alas! I have mispent my time, . My youth, my best, my strength, my bud, and prime, . Remembring not the dreadful day of Doom, . Nor yet the heavy reckoning for to come, . Though dangers do attend me every hour . And ghastly death oft threats me with her power: . Sometimes by wounds in idle combats taken, . Sometimes by Agues all my body shaken; . Sometimes by Fevers, all my moisture drinking, . My heart lies frying, and my eyes are sinking. . Sometimes the Cough, Stitch, painful Pleurisy, . With sad affrights of death, do menace me. . Sometimes the loathsome Pox my face be-mars . With ugly marks of his eternal scars. . Sometimes the Frenzy strangely mads my Brain . That oft for it in Bedlam I remain. . Too many's my Diseases to recite, . That wonder 'tis I yet behold the light, . That yet my bed in darkness is not made, . And I in black oblivion's den long laid. . Of Marrow full my bones, of Milk my breasts, . Ceas'd by the gripes of Serjeant Death's Arrests: . Thus I have said, and what I've said you see, . Childhood and youth is vain, yea vanity.  Middle Age.   . Childhood and youth forgot, sometimes I've seen, . And now am grown more staid that have been green, . What they have done, the same was done by me: . As was their praise, or shame, so mine must be. . Now age is more, more good ye do expect; . But more my age, the more is my defect. . But what's of worth, your eyes shall first behold, . And then a world of dross among my gold. . When my Wild Oats were sown, and ripe, and mown, . I then receiv'd a harvest of mine own. . My reason, then bad judge, how little hope . Such empty seed should yield a better crop. . I then with both hands graspt the world together, . Thus out of one extreme into another, . But yet laid hold on virtue seemingly: . Who climbs without hold, climbs dangerously. . Be my condition mean, I then take pains . My family to keep, but not for gains. . If rich, I'm urged then to gather more . To bear me out i' th' world and feed the poor; . If a father, then for children must provide, . But if none, then for kindred near ally'd; . If Noble, then mine honour to maintain; . If not, yet wealth, Nobility can gain. . For time, for place, likewise for each relation, . I wanted not my ready allegation. . Yet all my powers for self-ends are not spent, . For hundreds bless me for my bounty sent, . Whose loins I've cloth'd, and bellies I have fed, . With mine own fleece, and with my household bread. . Yea, justice I have done, was I in place, . To cheer the good and wicked to deface. . The proud I crush'd, th'oppressed I set free, . The liars curb'd but nourisht verity. . Was I a pastor, I my flock did feed . And gently lead the lambs, as they had need. . A Captain I, with skill I train'd my band . And shew'd them how in face of foes to stand. . If a Soldier, with speed I did obey . As readily as could my Leader say. . Was I a laborer, I wrought all day . As cheerfully as ere I took my pay. . Thus hath mine age (in all) sometimes done well; . Sometimes mine age (in all) been worse than hell. . In meanness, greatness, riches, poverty . Did toil, did broil; oppress'd, did steal and lie. . Was I as poor as poverty could be, . Then baseness was companion unto me. . Such scum as Hedges and High-ways do yield, . As neither sow, nor reap, nor plant, nor build. . If to Agriculture I was ordain'd, . Great labours, sorrows, crosses I sustain'd. . The early Cock did summon, but in vain, . My wakeful thoughts up to my painful gain. . For restless day and night, I'm robb'd of sleep . By cankered care, who sentinel doth keep. . My weary breast rest from his toil can find, . But if I rest, the more distrest my mind. . If happiness my sordidness hath found, . 'Twas in the crop of my manured ground: . My fatted Ox, and my exuberous Cow, . My fleeced Ewe, and ever farrowing Sow. . To greater things I never did aspire, . My dunghill thoughts or hopes could reach no higher. . If to be rich, or great, it was my fate. . How was I broil'd with envy, and with hate? . Greater than was the great'st was my desire, . And greater still, did set my heart on fire. . If honour was the point to which I steer'd, . To run my hull upon disgrace I fear'd, . But by ambitious sails I was so carried . That over flats, and sands, and rocks I hurried, . Opprest, and sunk, and sack'd, all in my way . That did oppose me to my longed bay. . My thirst was higher than Nobility . And oft long'd sore to taste on Royalty, . Whence poison, Pistols, and dread instruments . Have been curst furtherers of mine intents. . Nor Brothers, Nephews, Sons, nor Sires I've spar'd. . When to a Monarchy my way they barr'd, . There set, I rid my self straight out of hand . Of such as might my son, or his withstand, . Then heapt up gold and riches as the clay, . Which others scatter like the dew in May. . Sometimes vain-glory is the only bait . Whereby my empty school is lur'd and caught. . Be I of worth, of learning, or of parts, . I judge I should have room in all men's hearts; . And envy gnaws if any do surmount. . I hate for to be had in small account. . If Bias like, I'm stript unto my skin; . I glory in my wealth I have within. . Thus good, and bad, and what I am, you see, . Now in a word, what my diseases be: . The vexing Stone, in bladder and in reins, . Torments me with intolerable pains; . The windy cholic oft my bowels rend, . To break the darksome prison, where it's penn'd; . The knotty Gout doth sadly torture me, . And the restraining lame Sciatica; . The Quinsy and the Fevers often distaste me, . And the Consumption to the bones doth waste me, . Subject to all Diseases, that's the truth, . Though some more incident to age, or youth; . And to conclude, I may not tedious be, . Man at his best estate is vanity.  Old Age.  . What you have been, ev'n such have I before, . And all you say, say I, and something more. . Babe's innocence, Youth's wildness I have seen, . And in perplexed Middle-age have been, . Sickness, dangers, and anxieties have past, . And on this Stage am come to act my last. . I have been young, and strong, and wise as you . But now, Bis pueri senes is too true. . In every Age I've found much vanity. . An end of all perfection now I see. . It's not my valour, honour, nor my gold, . My ruin'd house, now falling can uphold; . It's not my Learning, Rhetoric, wit so large, . Now hath the power, Death's Warfare, to discharge. . It's not my goodly house, nor bed of down, . That can refresh, or ease, if Conscience frown; . Nor from alliance now can I have hope, . But what I have done well, that is my prop. . He that in youth is godly, wise, and sage . Provides a staff for to support his age. . Great mutations, some joyful, and some sad, . In this short Pilgrimage I oft have had. . Sometimes the Heavens with plenty smil'd on me, . Sometimes, again, rain'd all adversity; . Sometimes in honour, sometimes in disgrace, . Sometime an abject, then again in place: . Such private changes oft mine eyes have seen. . In various times of state I've also been. . I've seen a Kingdom flourish like a tree . When it was rul'd by that Celestial she, . And like a Cedar others so surmount . That but for shrubs they did themselves account. . Then saw I France, and Holland sav'd, Calais won, . And Philip and Albertus half undone. . I saw all peace at home, terror to foes, . But ah, I saw at last those eyes to close, . And then, me thought, the world at noon grew dark . When it had lost that radiant Sun-like spark. . In midst of griefs, I saw some hopes revive . (For 'twas our hopes then kept our hearts alive); . I saw hopes dash't, our forwardness was shent, . And silenc'd we, by Act of Parliament. . I've seen from Rome, an execrable thing, . A plot to blow up Nobles and their King. . I've seen designs at Ree and Cades cross't, . And poor Palatinate for every lost. . I've seen a Prince to live on others' lands, . A Royal one, by alms from Subjects' hands. . I've seen base men, advanc'd to great degree, . And worthy ones, put to extremity, . But not their Prince's love, nor state so high, . Could once reverse, their shameful destiny. . I've seen one stabb'd, another lose his head, . And others fly their Country through their dread. . I've seen, and so have ye, for 'tis but late, . The desolation of a goodly State. . Plotted and acted so that none can tell . Who gave the counsell, but the Prince of hell. . I've seen a land unmoulded with great pain, . But yet may live to see't made up again. . I've seen it shaken, rent, and soak'd in blood, . But out of troubles ye may see much good. . These are no old wives' tales, but this is truth. . We old men love to tell, what's done in youth. . But I return from whence I stept awry; . My memory is short and brain is dry. . My Almond-tree (gray hairs) doth flourish now, . And back, once straight, begins apace to bow. . My grinders now are few, my sight doth fail, . My skin is wrinkled, and my cheeks are pale. . No more rejoice, at music's pleasant noise, . But do awake at the cock's clanging voice. . I cannot scent savours of pleasant meat, . Nor sapors find in what I drink or eat. . My hands and arms, once strong, have lost their might. . I cannot labour, nor I cannot fight: . My comely legs, as nimble as the Roe, . Now stiff and numb, can hardly creep or go. . My heart sometimes as fierce, as Lion bold, . Now trembling, and fearful, sad, and cold. . My golden Bowl and silver Cord, e're long, . Shall both be broke, by wracking death so strong. . I then shall go whence I shall come no more. . Sons, Nephews, leave, my death for to deplore. . In pleasures, and in labours, I have found . That earth can give no consolation sound . To great, to rich, to poor, to young, or old, . To mean, to noble, fearful, or to bold. . From King to beggar, all degrees shall find . But vanity, vexation of the mind. . Yea, knowing much, the pleasant'st life of all . Hath yet amongst that sweet, some bitter gall. . Though reading others' Works doth much refresh, . Yet studying much brings weariness to th' flesh. . My studies, labours, readings all are done, . And my last period can e'en elmost run. . Corruption, my Father, I do call, . Mother, and sisters both; the worms that crawl . In my dark house, such kindred I have store. . There I shall rest till heavens shall be no more; . And when this flesh shall rot and be consum'd, . This body, by this soul, shall be assum'd; . And I shall see with these same very eyes . My strong Redeemer coming in the skies. . Triumph I shall, o're Sin, o're Death, o're Hell, . And in that hope, I bid you all farewell. O Lord, Thou hear'st my daily moan And see'st my dropping tears. My troubles all are Thee before, My longings and my fears.  Thou hitherto hast been my God; Thy help my soul hath found. Though loss and sickness me assailed, Through Thee I've kept my ground.  And Thy abode Thou'st made with me; With Thee my soul can talk; In secret places Thee I find Where I do kneel or walk.  Though husband dear be from me gone, Whom I do love so well, I have a more beloved one Whose comforts far excel.  O stay my heart on Thee. my God, Uphold my fainting soul. And when I know not what to do, I'll on Thy mercies roll.  My weakness. Thou dost know full well Of body and of mind; I in this world no comfort have, But what from Thee I find.  Though children Thou has given me, And friends I have also, Yet if I see Thee not through them They are no joy, but woe.  O shine upon me, blessed Lord, Ev'n for my Saviour's sake; In Thee alone is more than all, And there content I'll take.  O hear me, Lord, in this request As Thou before hast done, Bring back my husband, I beseech, As Thou didst once my son.  So shall I celebrate Thy praise Ev'n while my days shall last And talk to my beloved one Of all Thy goodness past.  So both of us Thy kindness, Lord, With praises shall recount And serve Thee better than before Whose blessings thus surmount.  But give me, Lord, a better heart, Then better shall I be, To pay the vows which I do owe Forever unto Thee.  Unless Thou help, what can I do But still my frailty show? If Thou assist me, Lord, I shall Return Thee what I owe. What shall I render to Thy name Or how Thy praises speak? My thanks how shall I testify? O Lord, Thou know'st I'm weak.  I owe so much, so little can Return unto Thy name, Confusion seizes on my soul, And I am filled with shame.  O Thou that hearest prayers, Lord, To Thee shall come all flesh Thou hast me heard and answered, My plaints have had access.  What did I ask for but Thou gav'st? What could I more desire? But thankfulness even all my days I humbly this require.  Thy mercies, Lord, have been so great In number numberless, Impossible for to recount Or any way express.  O help Thy saints that sought Thy face T' return unto Thee praise And walk before Thee as they ought, In strict and upright ways. Proem.  . Although great Queen, thou now in silence lie, . Yet thy loud Herald Fame, doth to the sky . Thy wondrous worth proclaim, in every clime, . And so has vow'd, whilst there is world or time. . So great's thy glory, and thine excellence, .

I prize thy love more than whole Mines of gold Or all the riches that the East doth hold. My love is such that Rivers cannot quench, Nor ought but love from thee give recompetence. Thy love is such I can no way repay. The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray. Then while we live, in love let's so persever That when we live no more, we may live ever. Come, my Lucasia, since we see That miracles Men's Faith do move, By wonder and by prodigy To the dull angry World let's prove There's a Religion in our Love.  For Though we were design'd t'agree, That Fate no liberty destroys, But our Election is as free As Angels, who with greedy choice Are yet determin'd to their joys.  Our hearts are doubled by the loss, Here Mixture is Addition grown; We both diffuse, and both ingross: And we whose minds are so much one, Never, yet ever are alone.  We court our own Captivity Than Thrones more great and innocent: `Twere banishment to be set free, Since we wear fetters whose intent Not Bondage is but Ornament  Divided joys are tedious found, And griefs united easier grow: We are our selves but by rebound, And all our Titles shuffled so, Both Princes, and both Subjects too.  Our Hearts are mutual Victims laid, While they (such power in Friendship lies) Are Altars, Priests, and Off'rings made: And each Heart which thus kindly dies, Grows deathless by the Sacrifice. Content, the false World's best disguise, The search and faction of the Wise, Is so abstruse and hid in night, That, like that Fairy Red-cross Knight, Who trech'rous Falshood for clear Truth had got, Men think they have it when they have it not.  For Courts Content would gladly own, But she ne're dwelt about a Throne: And to be flatter'd, rich, and great, Are things which do Mens senses cheat. But grave Experience long since this did see, Ambition and Content would ne're agree.  Some vainer would Content expect From what their bright Out-sides reflect: But sure Content is more Divine Then to be digg'd from Rock or Mine: And they that know her beauties will confess, She needs no lustre from a glittering dress.  In Mirth some place her, but she scorns Th'assistance of such crackling thorns, Nor owes her self to such thin sport, That is so sharp and yet so short: And Painters tell us, they the same strokes place To make a laughing and a weeping face.  Others there are that place Content In Liberty from Government: But who his Passions do deprave, Though free from shackles is a slave. Content and Bondage differ onely then, When we are chain'd by Vices, not by Men.  Some think the Camp Content does know, And that she fits o'th' Victor's brow: But in his Laurel there is seen Often a Cypress-bow between. Nor will Content herself in that place give, Where Noise and Tumult and Destruction live.  But yet the most Discreet believe, The Schools this Jewel do receive, And thus far's true without dispute, Knowledge is still the sweetest fruit. But whil'st men seek for Truth they lose their Peace; And who heaps Knowledge, Sorrow doth increase.  But now some sullen Hermite smiles, And thinks he all the World beguiles, And that his Cell and Dish contain What all mankind wish for in vain. But yet his Pleasure's follow'd with a Groan, For man was never born to be alone.  Content her self best comprehends Betwixt two souls, and they two friends, Whose either joyes in both are fixed, And multiply'd by being mixed: Whose minds and interests are still the same; Their Griefs, when once imparted, lose their name.  These far remov'd from all bold noise, And (what is worse) all hollow joyes, Who never had a mean design, Whose flame is serious and divine, And calm, and even, must contented be, For they've both Union and Society.  Then, my Lucasia, we have Whatever Love can give or crave; With scorn or pity can survey The Trifles which the most betray; With innocence and perfect friendship fired, By Vertue joyn'd, and by our Choice retired.  Whose Mirrours are the crystal Brooks, Or else each others Hearts and Looks; Who cannot wish for other things Then Privacy and Friendship brings: Whose thoughts and persons chang'd and mixt are one, Enjoy Content, or else the World hath none. I CANNOT hold, for though to write were rude, Yet to be silent were Ingratitude, And Folly too; for if Posterity Should never hear of such a one as thee, And onely know this Age's brutish fame, They would think Vertue nothing but a Name. And though far abler Pens must her define, Yet her Adoption hath engaged mine: And I must own where Merit shines so clear, 'Tis hard to write, but harder to forbear. Sprung from an ancient and an honour'd Stem, Who lent her lustre, and she paid it them; Who still in great and noble things appeared, Whom all their Country lov'd, and yet they feared. Match'd to another good and great as they, Who did their Country both oblige and sway. Behold herself, who had without dispute More then both Families could contribute. What early Beauty Grief and Age had broke, Her lovely Reliques and her Off-spring spoke. She was by nature and her Parents care A Woman long before most others are. But yet that antedated season she Improv'd to Vertue, not to Liberty. For she was still in either state of life Meek as a Virgin, Prudent as a Wife And she well knew, although so young and fair, Justly to mix Obedience Love and Care; Whil'st to her Children she did still appear So wisely kind, so tenderly severe, That they from her Rule and Example brought A native Honour, which she stampt and taught. Nor can a single Pen enough commend So kind a Sister and so clear a Friend. A Wisdom from above did her secure, Which as 'twas peaceable, was ever pure. And if well-order'd Commonwealths must be Patterns for every private Family, Her House, rul'd by her hand and by her eye, Might be a Pattern for a Monarchy. Solomon's wisest Woman less could do; She built her house, but this preserv'd hers too. She was so pious that when she did die, She scarce chang'd Place, I'm sure not Company. Her Zeal was primitive and practick too; She did believe, and pray, and read, and do. A firm and equal Soul she had engrost, Just ev'n to those that disoblig'd her most. She grew to love those wrongs she did receive For giving her the power to Forgive. Her Alms I may admire, but not relate; But her own works shall praise her in the gate. Her Life was checquer'd with afflictive years, And even her Comfort season'd in her Tears. Scarce for a Husband's loss her eyes were dried, And that loss by her Children half supplied, When Heav'n was pleas'd not these dear Propes' afford, But tore most off by sickness or by sword. She, who in them could still their Father boast, Was a fresh Widow every Son she lost. Litigious hands did her of Right deprive, That after all 'twas Penance to survive. She still these Griefs hath nobly undergone, Which few support at all, but better none. Such a submissive Greatness who can find? A tender Heart with so resolv'd a Mind? But she, though sensible, was still the same, Of a resigned Soul, untainted Fame, Nor were her Vertues coarsly set, for she Out-did Example in Civility. To bestow blessings, to oblige, relieve, Was all for which she could endure to live. She had a joy higher in doing good, Than they to whom the benefit accru'd. Though none of Honour had a quicker sense, Never had Woman more of complacence; Yet lost it not in empty forms, but still Her Nature noble was, her Soul gentile. And as in Youth she did attract, (for she The Verdure had without the Vanity) So she in Age was mild and grave to all, Was not morose, but was majestical. Thus from all other Women she had skill To draw their good, but nothing of their ill. And since she knew the mad tumultuous World, Saw Crowns revers'd, Temples to ruine hurl'd; She in Retirement chose to shine and burn, As a bright Lamp shut in some Roman Urn. At last, when spent with sickness, grief and age, Her Guardian Angel did her death presage: (So that by strong impulse she chearfully Dispensed blessings, and went home to die; That so she might, when to that place removed, Marry his Ashes whom she ever loved) She dy'd, gain'd a reward, and paid a debt. The Sun himself did never brighter set. Happy were they that knew her and her end, More happy they that did from her descend: A double blessing they may hope to have, One she convey'd to them, and one she gave. All that are hers are therefore sure to be Blest by Inheritance and Legacy. A Royal Birth had less advantage been. 'Tis more to die a Saint than live a Queen. We will not like those men our offerings pay Who crown the cup, then think they crown the day. We make no garlands, nor an altar build, Which help not Joy, but Ostentation yield. Where mirth is justly grounded these wild toyes Are but a troublesome, and empty noise.  . But these shall be my great Solemnities, Orinda's wishes for Cassandra's bliss. May her Content be as unmix'd and pure As my Affection, and like that endure; And that strong Happiness may she still find Not owing to her Fortune, but her Mind.  . May her Content and Duty be the same, And may she know no Grief but in the name. May his and her Pleasure and Love be so Involv'd and growing, that we may not know Who most Affection or most Peace engrost; Whose Love is strongest, or whose Bliss is most.  . May nothing accidental e're appear But what shall with new bonds their Souls endear; And may they count the hours as they pass, By their own Joys, and not by Sun or Glass: While every day like this may Sacred prove To Friendship, Gratitude, and Strictest Love. Come, my Ardelia, to this bowre, Where kindly mingling Souls a while, Let's innocently spend an houre, And at all serious follys smile  Here is no quarrelling for Crowns, Nor fear of changes in our fate; No trembling at the Great ones frowns Nor any slavery of state.  Here's no disguise, nor treachery Nor any deep conceal'd design; From blood and plots this place is free, And calm as are those looks of thine.  Here let us sit and bless our Starres Who did such happy quiet give, As that remov'd from noise of warres. In one another's hearts we live.  We should we entertain a feare? Love cares not how the world is turn'd. If crouds of dangers should appeare, Yet friendship can be unconcern'd.  We weare about us such a charme, No horrour can be our offence; For misheif's self can doe no harme To friendship and to innocence.  Let's mark how soone Apollo's beams Command the flocks to quit their meat, And not intreat the neighbour -- streams To quench their thirst, but coole their heat.  In such a scorching Age as this, Whoever would not seek a shade Deserve their happiness to misse, As having their own peace betray'd.  But we (of one another's mind Assur'd,) the boistrous world disdain; With quiet souls, and unconfin'd, Enjoy what princes wish in vain. WHat on Earth deserves our trust ? Youth and Beauty both are dust. Long we gathering are with pain, What one moment calls again. Seven years childless, marriage past, A Son, a son is born at last : So exactly lim'd and fair. Full of good Spirits, Meen, and Air, As a long life promised, Yet, in less than six weeks dead. Too promising, too great a mind In so small room to be confin'd : Therefore, as fit in Heav'n to dwell, He quickly broke the Prison shell. So the subtle Alchimist, Can't with Hermes Seal resist The powerful spirit's subtler flight, But t'will bid him long good night. And so the Sun if it arise Half so glorious as his Eyes, Like this Infant, takes a shrowd, Buried in a morning Cloud. Soule of my soule! my Joy, my crown, my friend! A name which all the rest doth comprehend; How happy are we now, whose sols are grown, By an incomparable mixture, One: Whose well acquainted minds are not as neare As Love, or vows, or secrets can endeare. I have no thought but what's to thee reveal'd, Nor thou desire that is from me conceal'd. Thy heart locks up my secrets richly set, And my breast is thy private cabinet. Thou shedst no teare but what but what my moisture lent, And if I sigh, it is thy breath is spent. United thus, what horrour can appeare Worthy our sorrow, anger, or our feare? Let the dull world alone to talk and fight And with their vast ambitions nature fright; Let them despise so innocent a flame, While Envy, pride, and faction play their game: But we by Love sublim'd so high shall rise, To pitty Kings, and Conquerours despise, Since we that sacred union have engrost, Which they and all the sullen world have lost. Forbear, bold youth; all 's heaven here,   And what you do aver To others courtship may appear,   'Tis sacrilege to her. She is a public deity;   And were 't not very odd She should dispose herself to be   A petty household god?  First make the sun in private shine   And bid the world adieu, That so he may his beams confine   In compliment to you: But if of that you do despair,   Think how you did amiss To strive to fix her beams which are   More bright and large than his. If I could ever write a lasting verse, It should be laid, deare Sainte, upon thy herse. But Sorrow is no muse, and doth confesse That it least can what most it would expresse. Yet, that I may some bounds to griefe allow, I'le try if I can weepe in numbers now. Ah beauteous blossom! too untimely dead! Whither, ah whither is thy sweetness fled? Where are the charmes that allwayes did arise From the prevailing languadge [sic] of thine eyes? Where is thy modest aire and lovely meen, And all the wonders that in these were seen? Alas! in vaine! In vaine on three I rave; There is no pitty in the stupid grave . . . Never, ah never let glad parents guesse At one remove of future happinesse, But reckon children 'mong those passing joys, Which one hour gives, and the next hour destroyes. Alas! we were secure of our content, But find too late that it was onely lent, To be a mirrour wherein we might see How fraile we are, how innocent should be. But if to thy blest soule my griefe appeares, Forgive and pitty these injurious teares; Impute them to affection's sad excesse, Which will not yeild to nature's tendernesse, Since 'twas through dearest tyes and highest trust Continu'd from thy cradle to thy dust; And so rewarded and confirm'd by thine, (wo is me!) I thought thee too much mine. But I'le resigne, and follow thee as fast As my unhappy minutes will make hast. Till when, the fresh remembrances of thee Shall be my emblem of mortalitie. For such a loss as thine, bright soule, is not Ever to be repaired, or forgot. Most wonderful and strange it seems, that I Who but a little time ago was tost High on the waves of passion and of pain, With aching heat and wildly throbbing brain, Who peered into the darkness, deeming vain All things there found if but One thing were lost, Thus calm and still and silent here should lie, Watching and waiting, --waiting passively.  The dark has faded, and before mine eyes Have long, grey flats expanded, dim and bare; And through the changing guises all things wear Inevitable Law I recognise: Yet in my heart a hint of feeling lies Which half a hope and half a despair. I tell thee, Dick, where I have been, Where I the rarest things have seen, O, things without compare! Such sights again cannot be found In any place on English ground, Be it at wake or fair.  At Charing Cross, hard by the way Where we, thou know'st, do sell our hay, There is a house with stairs; And there did I see coming down Such folks as are not in our town, Forty at least, in pairs.  Amongst the rest, one pest'lent fine (His beard no bigger, though, than thine) Walked on before the rest: Our landlord looks like nothing to him; The King (God bless him!) 'twould undo him, Should he go still so dressed.  At course-a-park, without all doubt, He should have first been taken out By all the maids i' th' town: Though lusty Roger there had been, Or little George upon the Green, Or Vincent of the Crown.  But wot you what? the youth was going To make an end of all his wooing; The Parson for him stayed. Yet, by his leave, for all his haste, He did not so much wish all past, Perchance, as did the maid.  The maid (and thereby hangs a tale), For such a maid no Whitsun-ale Could ever yet produce; No grape that's kindly ripe could be So round, so plump, so soft, as she, Nor half so full of juice!  Her finger was so small the ring Would not stay on, which they did bring; It was too wide a peck: And to say truth (for out it must), It looked like a great collar (just) About our young colt's neck.  Her feet beneath her petticoat, Like little mice, stole in and out, As if they feared the light: But oh! she dances such a way, No sun upon an Easter Day Is half so fine a sight!  He would have kissed her once or twice, But she would not, she was so nice, She would not do 't in sight: And then she looked as who should say "I will do what I list today, And you shall do 't at night."  Her cheeks so rare a white was on, No daisy makes comparison, (Who sees them is undone), For streaks of red were mingled there, Such as are on a Catherine pear, (The side that's next the sun).  Her lips were red, and one was thin Compared to that was next her chin, - (Some bee had stung it newly); But, Dick, her eyes so guard her face, I durst no more upon them gaze Than on the sun in July.  Her mouth so small, when she does speak Thou'dst swear her teeth her words did break, That they might passage get; But she so handled still the matter, They came as good as ours, or better, And are not spent a whit.  If wishing should be any sin, The Parson himself had guilty been, (She looked that day so purely); And, did the youth so oft the feat At night, as some did in conceit, It would have spoiled him surely.  Just in the nick, the cook knocked thrice, And all the waiters in a trice His summons did obey. Each servingman, with dish in hand, Marched boldly up, like our trained band, Presented, and away.  When all the meat was on the table, What man of knife or teeth was able To stay to be entreated? And this the very reason was, Before the parson could say grace, The company was seated.  The business of the kitchen's great, For it is fit that man should eat; Nor was it there denied. Passion o' me, how I run on! There's that that would be thought upon, I trow, besides the bride.  Now hats fly off, and youths carouse, Healths first go round, and then the house: The bride's came thick and thick; And when 'twas named another's health, Perhaps he made it hers by stealth. And who could help it, Dick?  O' th' sudden, up they rise and dance; Then sit again and sigh and glance; Then dance again and kiss. Thus several ways the time did pass, Whilst every woman wished her place, And every man wished his!  By this time all were stolen aside To counsel and undress the bride; But that he must not know; And yet 'twas thought he guessed her mind, And did not mean to stay behind Above an hour or so.  When in he came, Dick, there she lay Like new-fallen snow melting away ('Twas time, I trow, to part). Kisses were now the only stay, Which soon she gave, as one would say, "God-be-with-ye, with all my heart."  But, just as Heavens would have, to cross it, In came the bridesmaids with the posset: The bridegroom ate in spite; For, had he left the women to 't, It would have cost two hours to do 't, Which were too much that night.  At length the candle's out, and now All that they had not done they do; What that is, who can tell? But I believe it was no more Than thou and I have done before With Bridget and with Nell. I sit on the tracks, a hundred feet from earth, fifty from the water. Gerald is inching toward me as grim, slow, and determined as a season, because he has no trade and wants none. It's been nine months since I last listened to his fate, but I know what he will say: he's the fire hydrant of the underdog.  When he reaches my point above the creek, he sits down without salutation, and spits profoundly out past the edge, and peeks for meaning in the ripple it brings. He scowls. He speaks: when you walk down any street you see nothing but coagulations of shit and vomit, and I'm sick of it. I suggest suicide; he prefers murder, and spits again for the sake of all the great devout losers.  A conductor's horn concerto breaks the air, and we, two doomed pennies on the track, shove off and somersault like anesthetized fleas, ruffling the ideal locomotive poised on the water with our light, dry bodies. Gerald shouts terrifically as he sails downstream like a young man with a destination. I swim toward shore as fast as my boots will allow; as always, neglecting to drown. Some people go their whole lives without ever writing a single poem. Extraordinary people who don't hesitate to cut somebody's heart or skull open. They go to baseball games with the greatest of ease. and play a few rounds of golf as if it were nothing. These same people stroll into a church as if that were a natural part of life. Investing money is second nature to them. They contribute to political campaigns that have absolutely no poetry in them and promise none for the future. They sit around the dinner table at night and pretend as though nothing is missing. Their children get caught shoplifting at the mall and no one admits that it is poetry they are missing. The family dog howls all night, lonely and starving for more poetry in his life. Why is it so difficult for them to see that, without poetry, their lives are effluvial. Sure, they have their banquets, their celebrations, croquet, fox hunts, their sea shores and sunsets, their cocktails on the balcony, dog races, and all that kissing and hugging, and don't forget the good deeds, the charity work, nursing the baby squirrels all through the night, filling the birdfeeders all winter, helping the stranger change her tire. Still, there's that disagreeable exhalation from decaying matter, subtle but everpresent. They walk around erect like champions. They are smooth-spoken and witty. When alone, rare occasion, they stare into the mirror for hours, bewildered. There was something they meant to say, but didn't: "And if we put the statue of the rhinoceros next to the tweezers, and walk around the room three times, learn to yodel, shave our heads, call our ancestors back from the dead--" poetrywise it's still a bust, bankrupt. You haven't scribbled a syllable of it. You're a nowhere man misfiring the very essence of your life, flustering nothing from nothing and back again. The hereafter may not last all that long. Radiant childhood sweetheart, secret code of everlasting joy and sorrow, fanciful pen strokes beneath the eyelids: all day, all night meditation, knot of hope, kernel of desire, pure ordinariness of life seeking, through poetry, a benediction or a bed to lie down on, to connect, reveal, explore, to imbue meaning on the day's extravagant labor. And yet it's cruel to expect too much. It's a rare species of bird that refuses to be categorized. Its song is barely audible. It is like a dragonfly in a dream-- here, then there, then here again, low-flying amber-wing darting upward then out of sight. And the dream has a pain in its heart the wonders of which are manifold, or so the story is told. All night a door floated down the river. It tried to remember little incidents of pleasure from its former life, like the time the lovers leaned against it kissing for hours and whispering those famous words. Later, there were harsh words and a shoe was thrown and the door was slammed. Comings and goings by the thousands, the early mornings and late nights, years, years. O they've got big plans, they'll make a bundle. The door was an island that swayed in its sleep. The moon turned the doorknob just slightly, burned its fingers and ran, and still the door said nothing and slept. At least that's what they like to say, the little fishes and so on. Far away, a bell rang, and then a shot was fired. This is the hardest part: When I came back to life I was a good family dog and not too friendly to strangers. I got a thirty-five dollar raise in salary, and through the pea-soup fogs I drove the General, and introduced him at rallies. I had a totalitarian approach and was a massive boost to his popularity. I did my best to reduce the number of people. The local bourgeoisie did not exist. One of them was a mystic and walked right over me as if I were a bed of hot coals. This is par for the course- I will be employing sundry golf metaphors henceforth, because a dog, best friend and chief advisor to the General, should. While dining with the General I said, "Let's play the back nine in a sacred rage. Let's tee-off over the foredoomed community and putt ourselves thunderously, touching bottom." He drank it all in, rugged and dusky. I think I know what he was thinking. He held his automatic to my little head and recited a poem about my many weaknesses, for which I loved him so. for my father, -  Your face did not rot like the others--the co-pilot, for example, I saw him  yesterday. His face is corn- mush: his wife and daughter, the poor ignorant people, stare  as if he will compose soon. He was more wronged than Job. But your face did not rot  like the others--it grew dark, and hard like ebony; the features progressed in their  distinction. If I could cajole you to come back for an evening, down from your compulsive  orbiting, I would touch you, read your face as Dallas, your hoodlum gunner, now,  with the blistered eyes, reads his braille editions. I would touch your face as a disinterested  scholar touches an original page. However frightening, I would discover you, and I would not  turn you in; I would not make you face your wife, or Dallas, or the co-pilot, Jim. You  could return to your crazy orbiting, and I would not try to fully understand what  it means to you. All I know is this: when I see you, as I have seen you at least  once every year of my life, spin across the wilds of the sky like a tiny, African god,  I feel dead. I feel as if I were the residue of a stranger's life, that I should pursue you.  My head cocked toward the sky, I cannot get off the ground, and, you, passing over again,  fast, perfect, and unwilling to tell me that you are doing well, or that it was mistake  that placed you in that world, and me in this; or that misfortune placed these worlds in us. I take the long walk up the staircase to my secret room. Today's big news: they found Amelia Earhart's shoe, size . : Charlie Christian is bebopping at Minton's in . Today, the Presidential primaries have failed us once again. We'll look for our excitement elsewhere, in the last snow that is falling, in tomorrow's Gospel Concert in Springfield. It's a good day to be a cat and just sleep. Or to read the Confessions of Saint Augustine. Jesus called the sons of Zebedee the Sons of Thunder. In my secret room, plans are hatched: we'll explore the Smoky Mountains. Then we'll walk along a beach: Hallelujah! (A letter was just delivered by Overnight Express-- it contained nothing of importance, I slept through it.) (I guess I'm trying to be "above the fray.") The Russians, I know, have developed a language called "Lincos" designed for communicating with the inhabitants of other worlds. That's been a waste of time, not even a postcard. But then again, there are tree-climbing fish, called anabases. They climb the trees out of stupidity, or so it is said. Who am I to judge? I want to break out of here. A bee is not strong in geometry: it cannot tell a square from a triangle or a circle. The locker room of my skull is full of panting egrets. I'm saying that strictly for effect. In time I will heal, I know this, or I believe this. The contents and furnishings of my secret room will be labeled and organized so thoroughly it will be a little frightening. What I thought was infinite will turn out to be just a couple of odds and ends, a tiny miscellany, miniature stuff, fragments of novelties, of no great moment. But it will also be enough, maybe even more than enough, to suggest an immense ritual and tradition. And this makes me very happy. Jesus got up one day a little later than usual. He had been dream- ing so deep there was nothing left in his head. What was it? A nightmare, dead bodies walking all around him, eyes rolled back, skin falling off. But he wasn't afraid of that. It was a beau- tiful day.  How 'bout some coffee? Don't mind if I do. Take a little ride on my donkey, I love that donkey. Hell, I love everybody. She has one good bumblebee which she leads about town on a leash of clover. It's as big as a Saint Bernard but also extremely fragile. People want to pet its long, shaggy coat. These would be mostly whirling dervishes out shopping for accessories. When Lily winks they understand everything, right down to the particle of a butterfly's wing lodged in her last good eye, so the situation is avoided, the potential for a cataclysm is narrowly averted, and the bumblebee lugs its little bundle of shaved nerves forward, on a mission from some sick, young godhead. gle or a circle.
